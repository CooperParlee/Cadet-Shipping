# Part 9 Engine Room Records and Watch Standing Practices (All Vessels) {.unnumbered}

1.  List and describe in detail the duties of the assistant engineers on your vessel, with emphasis on the third assistant’s role. What, if any, of these duties were you allowed to perform?

The third engineer had quite a few responsibilities to various systems aboard the ship. He was responsible for the black and gray water systems, the stern tube, the bilges and many of the safety systems on the ship, specifically the EDG. For the sewage systems, he would be in charge of cleaning the tanks and discharging waste when instructed to do so by the first engineer. He was also in charge of the maintenance on the stern tube (which I did not see while I was aboard) and keeping that system clean. When bilges needed to be pumped, he would be the one to pump, move them and clean them. He also would do "safety Sundays" where he would do any of the preventative maintenance tasks associated with the safety and lifesaving equipment with the third mate. They would actuate the fast rescue boat and start the lifeboat engine as well as start the emergency diesel generator.

The second engineer was in charge of the boiler (his largest responsibility), the air systems and the freshwater systems. He also was delegated a lot of irregular duties from the first engineer (such as generator items). He would be responsible for any boiler maintenance and troubleshooting any issues that came up. He did all of the servicing on the air compressors and managed the oil levels in the start air compressors. He also maintained the logbook for the fresh water evaporator and potable water systems.

The first engineer acted a lot more like a chief on my vessel. He assigned a lot of tasks and managed the oilers. He was technically responsible for the generators, electrical system, steering gear, bow thruster and main engine and would lead and involve himself in tasks relating to those pieces of machinery. Though he often delegated these tasks to myself, the third and sometimes the second engineer, he was technically responsible for megging generators, engine maintenance, tracking down grounds and any technical/electrical issues within the engine room.

As far as tasks I was allowed to perform, I often performed a lot of the basic grunt work maintenance that these engineers did not want to perform. Essentially, I was an overqualified oiler. I would rebuild valves, clean scavenger air boxes, bilges, clean strainers, start up the Nyrex, etc, etc. Sometimes I was allowed to do more advanced things under the supervision of the engineers like electrical testing, air conditioner maintenance, boiler cleaning, etc. but generally if the task was the "duty" of an engineer, they would supervise me doing it if I were to help them with it.

2.  List and describe how fuel remaining on board is calculated. What are the various tables used? How are corrections made to these figures (for trim, heel, and temperature)?

The fuel remaining on board is calculated automatically using the Kongsberg system. The system has a list of tanks on the vessel, what fuel is in them and the respective level via tank level indicators (TLI). If a precise measurement was needed, the chief engineer would send the third engineer to go and take soundings for the various tanks. From there, he would sound the tank and then use the tank table for the respective trim of the vessel. Temperature was not something that the engineers really accommodated for, but they would note it in their record books. That way, if there were any "missing" items on the oil record book, for example, they would be able to suggest that a discrepancy in a few cubic meters of heavy oil could be due to the fact that an original sounding was taken under heat. Also, the vessel rarely heeled. However, if the ship was rolling a lot, a couple soundings would be taken to minimize the effect of tank sloshing for lower viscosity fuel tanks like diesel.

![Example of a tank sounding table found for the main engine lube oil sump](Pictures/part9/tank_table_ex.png)

3.  List and describe the system used to keep track of spare parts on the vessel. If no system was used on your ship, describe how a system might be instituted.

My ship had a very elegant system to keep track of spare parts. It was all built into NSE, which maintained the inventory from delivery. Once a part was delivered, it would show up in the inventory view. The engineers would take the physical parts and their packages and print out storage labels for them. The storage labels would have the ship, the equipment it was for, manufacturer, part name, location, part number in NSE and the manufacturer part number. Here was an example of a label on a drinking water filter:

**Ship**: ARC INDEPENDENCE **EQP**: 584.01 COLD WATER FOUNTAINS **MFG**: (not provided) **PART**: FILTER FOR D.W FOUNTAIN **LOC**: ME STORE 06*06-03-03 **P/N**: 584.01.SKPM-SML-053-00* WALL-8530004028 **PIN**: 12801

The location information was the most elegant part here. The main engine store room's cabinets were all numbered, as were the shelves. Consider the location for the above part (06-03-03); 06 corresponds to the sixth cabinet, 03 corresponds to the third shelf down, and 03 corresponds to the third column in that shelf. Sometimes there would be a fourth number at the end, which was if the shelf was a drawer and it corresponded to the numbered containment within that drawer. If you ever needed a spare part for routine maintenance, often the machine would have the same printed out label as was found on the part itself. For example, when I was replacing a belt on an air conditioner, it had the EQP number. All I had to do was log into NSE, search for that number and it would tell me if we had any spares and where they were located. This system made it very easy to keep track of how many spares were available of a certain part and really saved time finding them when needed.

4.  What is meant by the term "trend analysis"? How does this relate to engine room records? Explain how trend analysis was conducted on your ship, including equipment analyzed, and how often.

Trend analysis is the practice of doing tests at regular intervals to observe both short and long-term metrics in a system. Keeping track of trends in an engine room is very important because it allows an operator to recognize when a value might be problematic or preemptively recognize a system that is decaying outside of design limits. As far as engine room records, this is why it is very important to keep detailed engine room records-- it allows you to use invaluable tools to run your plant more effectively and prevent downtime. Trend analysis was conducted for most of the important machinery in the engine room. Generally, more sophisticated trend analysis was conducted for the diesel generators and the main engine. All performance metrics produced by the D/G and M/E performance tests were tracked and graphed over time. This way, if the system didn't automatically recognize that a value was out of operating margins, the engineers could clearly see if a metric was trending down. Consider compression pressures recorded on the MAN PMI Variable Injection Timing system; if over time the engineers saw a trending decrease in compression pressures for one specific cylinder, they would be able to predict that a compression ring could be failing. Likewise, for lube oil, if levels of iron in the lube oil samples was increasing at a gradual rate, they could recognize that components within the main engine are wearing predictably. However, if the values suddenly increased substantially from one test to the next, it's a sign that a wear element is wearing really quickly, and it's time to stop and reevaluate. The prime movers were subject to more scrupulous trend analysis than other equipment, but really trend analysis was being conducted with all equipment when the engineers submitted completed preventative maintenance tasks on the NSE system as long as the engineers were doing their jobs correctly. In an inspection, an engineer might mention that there was water observed dripping from a pump. The next time, other engineers report the same. Eventually, another engineer reports that there's a huge puddle of water around that pump. The last engineer could go back and check the maintenance and inspection records and recognize a trend that the pump was leaking and come to the conclusion that the pump here needs maintenance.

5.  What process was used to track operating hours on the main propulsion unit and its associated equipment between overhauls?

The chief engineer used two different systems to track operating hours on the main propulsion unit and equipment between overhauls. Once a month, the chief would go in and update the current main engine hours in an Excel sheet. That Excel sheet had all of the hours of the last overhauls on each respective component within the main engine. From there, the sheet would calculate the hours on each piece of equipment. Additionally, he also updated a program called NSE where these same hours were logged. That system would then make preventative maintenance recommendations. However, at some point in recent history, a port engineer switched the system for logging hours in NSE in a way that made it much less useful and accurate so the chief mostly relied on the Excel sheet to log operating hours. Additionally, the crew made overhauls by inspection rather than operating hours given guidance by MAN to prolong the lifespan of most of the components. MAN figures that it is more reliable to keep using equipment that is broken in and fine via inspection rather than take a risk in using new equipment.

6.  Explain how maintenance performed on the main propulsion units was recorded, including bearing clearances, limitations, tests performed and inspection results.

Maintenance performed on the main propulsion units was recorded in NSE. When an engineer carried out a maintenance task, they could attach any documents associated with the maintenance task. Often this included clearances, tests performed (or that were unable to be performed) and inspection results but obviously depended on the preventative maintenance item. Additionally, for more important trend analysis, they would often put those items into Excel format on the shared company Google Drive, that way the port engineers could also access them ashore and the trend could be visualized over time (they'd make graphs).

7.  Explain how maintenance was scheduled.

Maintenance was scheduled in a program named NSE and supplemented by an Excel sheet the chief made. Each morning, the chief and first engineers would get a report of all of the preventative maintenance items that would be coming due soon or were past due in NSE. Some of these suggestions were inaccurate, so they would go and consult the Excel sheet to see hours on equipment to see whether that piece of equipment should be inspected and potentially overhauled. Once this was done, they would update both pieces of software with the operating hours and date that the maintenance was conducted such that they would know when maintenance would next need to be performed.

8.  List and describe what type of records were maintained on fuel oil, fresh water, lube oil, and feed water carried and consumed.

The records on fuel oil, fresh water, lube oil and feed water were all recorded within one sheet in Excel. For fuel oil, bunker records were taken, then verified with soundings to adjust tank levels in a program called S-Insight. For consumption, generator, incinerator and main engine flow meters recorded diesel and heavy fuel consumed in cubic meters. Then, every afternoon, the chief engineer would create the noon report with the consumption values for the day. These would be added to S-Insight and removed from the tanks. For fresh water, similar flow meters were found on the potable water tank and Nyrex. Freshwater produced would be added to the S-Insight and the hydro tank numbers would be subtracted. For lube oil, only cylinder oil was tracked by the Alfa Lube system and entered into the S-Insight and Excel document. For feed water, there was a flow meter before the boiler cascade tank to measure how much water was used by both the aux and exhaust gas boiler systems.

9.  Fill out a typical noon report (or a midnight report if used on your ship).

11. Provide a reproduced and completed oiler's round of temperatures and pressures for one underway watch.

Though we do not stand watches except for maneuvering, here is a completed oiler's round:

![Completed oiler's round from 12 May](Pictures/part9/oiler_round.jpg)

12. In detail, describe the process of taking over a watch at sea. Also, describe what actions you would take to make a complete round of the engine room during a watch at sea. Or, if there was not a watch procedure, describe in detail how you would go about assuming the DUTY for the day in an unmanned engine room.

We did not have regular at-sea watches as we had an engine room. This watch question is more relevant to our maneuvering watches. However, if I had a duty day, I would begin by arriving 20-25 minutes before the end of the other engineers' overtime day work. I would take note of all of the items on the running board, which was a good diagram of everything that was running at the time. However, it was often not totally up to date. With this information in my notes, I would make a complete round of the engine room, beginning at the engine control room, going up the stack staircase (called the fiddly on my vessel) and checking the tank levels on all of the expansion tanks (oil, LT and jacket water). Coming down the staircase, I would check the boiler water cascade tank and the aux and EGB boiler pressures and levels, then the turbocharger pressure differential. After that, I would go down from the upper engine room into the mid level and check all of the equipment there, which included sea water, jacket water, lube oil and LT water pumps and coolers, Moatti lube oil filters, the evaporator and the Alpha Lubricator cylinder lubricators to make sure the engine was getting lubricated. As I'm walking around, I'm now looking for leaks, expensive noises, hot spots and vibrations that don't feel right. With this level completed, I would next move to the lower engine room, where I would check the bilge and ballast pumps, Nyrex ejector pumps and the lower engine. Again, I'm looking for leaks, noises, hot spots and vibrations coming from any of the equipment on that level. Next, I would proceed to shaft alley where I would check the bilge wells, the shaft generator, bearings and stern tube for any of the above issues. The stern tube lube oil cooler was known to leak, so usually on my round, I would wipe it down. With the main engine room done, I would proceed up to the upper level of the engine room and go check the main switchboard room. There is very little to look for here besides water where it doesn't belong and noises. It's one of those situations where you know it when you see it. Next, I would check the steering gear room. I would take a look out for leaks in the RORO hydraulic system and pressure issues with the steering gear. The steering gear regularly had issues with making loud noises as the pumps would change direction, so really the priority here is looking out for noises that are out of the ordinary. With the steering gear horseshoe complete, I would then check the generator room where I would look for the same issues as the main engine; I would be looking for major oil and fuel leaks, temperatures on the heat exchangers, pressure on the start air emergency tank and ultimately anything that was out of the ordinary.

With that information complete, I would return to the engine control room and update the running board with what was actually open and/or running. Then I would discuss with the engineer who was on duty before me of any changes or issues I would need to be aware of and any questions I had from walking around the engine room. After I had been properly relived, I would then assume the night watch where I would do a couple of hourly rounds until 2300 before turning the engine room unmanned and turning on the pager.

13. What information is found in the engineer’s turnover reports/notes to their relief counterpart(s)? Describe the company’s policy for these reports. Are they saved or shared?

On my ship, the turnover notes were highly extensive. I was only provided a copy of the first engineer's turnover notes. Though they were highly informal, they included information in a list of nearly everything conducted on the day to day. Preventative maintenance, issues, deck work, technician visits, etc. All of this information was sorted by respective piece of equipment. Here is a block pertaining to the generators by Brian Barnes:

\> The HT cooling pump for the D/G's was rebuilt and ready for use. We have a new firing pressure gauge on order. Wasn't able to do a performance test on inbd D/G. All diesel valves for both D/G's are painted yellow so there is no more confusion with 3rd A/E's. Changed out one of the HFO vale on the outbd D/G (3rd snapped off the stem).

Pulled and cleaned both D/G flame screens on top of stack In Bremerhaven, we isolated the D/G pre-heater for the welders to weld up a pin hole leak on the expansion joint. We pressure tested the unit, installed all new lagging and re-attached the shrouding.

15 April we changed out the D/G F/O moatti filter for the 2nd time this trip. \</

The first engineer's running turnover notes were kept as a daily log and were not formatted as an equipment-specific list like the previous first engineer. The turnover notes were kept over time in the engineers' shared drive and there was no specific policy for them from the company.

14. How often was lubricating oil tested on board? What tests are performed?

Lubricating oil was tested on board roughly every couple of weeks according to the third engineer or as needed for other preventative maintenance items. Such items included the main engine performance test and required sampling the cylinder lube oil. This was done in addition to the bi-weekly lubricating oil tests. Tests performed included water content, base number, fuel-oil dilution, viscosity (at various temperatures) and an iron test.

15. How often were lube samples sent ashore for testing? List tests performed. (Attach copy of oil analysis sheet if available). Explain the significance of each test.

Lube oil samples were sent sporadically for my vessel. According to the lube oil sample sheet I received, the last 4 tests were dated 29 August, 2024; 27 September, 2024; 5 April, 2025; 23 April 2025. According to the third engineer, this testing was supposed to be conducted as often as every month to as much as 2 months, but this pattern was interrupted by shipyard periods last fall. Tests included total base number (TBN), iron, corrected iron, chromium, tin, lead, copper, aluminum, vanadium, WPI, water content, sodium, silicon, calcium, zinc, phosphorus, barium, and molybdenum. Total base number is a metric of how much acid the lube oil is able to neutralize. At manufacture, the TBN should be fairly high because the oil should not acidify as this will cause corrosion to the engine. If TBN drops, it is an indication of excessive blowby from the engine due to the sulfur content of the combustion products. Sulfur forms sulfuric acid (from the water in combustion products) and neutralizes some of the base additives of the lube oil. Iron, chromium, tin, lead, copper, aluminum, and vanadium are all component metals of the engine. If they're turning up in the lube oil, it means components within the engine are wearing. Water content, sodium, and silicon are metrics relating to contamination. The water might come from a cooler leak, either jacket water or salt water cooling. The difference can be identified in the presence of sodium or silicon. Sodium indicates the likelihood of salt water cooling leakage somewhere in the system. Silicon is usually a component of additives for jacket water. As such, it is likely that jacket water is leaking into the main engine if this metric is suddenly very high. See appendix for attached Shell LubeAnalyst cylinder lubricating oil tests.

16. Explain how the lube test samples were obtained, including sample point location, for equipment that was tested.

There were two types of lube oil test samples obtained for the main engine: system oil and cylinder oil. System oil was collected after the Moatti lube-oil filters and was obtained by opening the sample-point globe valve and then operating the kick-valve to discharge oil into a sampling container.

![Main engine system oil sampling point after the Moatti filters](Pictures/part9/melo_sample.jpg)

The cylinder oil could be obtained at each cylinder and drained from the stuffing box of each cylinder. It was obtained by opening a small ball valve connected to a goose-neck from which the oil drained.

![Main engine cylinder oil sampling point](Pictures/part9/cyl_sample.jpg)

Since the diesel generators ran on a single oil for the whole system, there was a single drain for the whole machine which resembled the cylinder oil drain and was located on the driving end of the generator.

![Diesel engine oil sampling point](Pictures/part9/gen_sample.png)

17. What is the make and model number of the fuel and lube oil purifiers used?

All four purifiers aboard my vessel were made by Alfa Laval. The two fuel oil purifiers were model S861 and the two lube oil purifiers were model S831.

![Alfa Laval S831 lube oil purifier nameplate](Pictures/part9/Alfa_831.jpg)

18. Discuss in detail any operational problem encountered with a fuel or lube oil purifier while you were onboard. If no problems were encountered, possibly the engineers could provide you with some working history – good or bad – of the purifiers.

On May 27th, the main engine lube oil purifier pump started discharging lube oil into the containment below it in the main engine room. This occurred because the third engineer was unaware of the fact that valves to the purifier are secured when the purifier is brought offline (as it was the day prior) because the head pressure on the pumps is enough to allow lube oil to leak from the seals of the pump if the valves are not closed. Given that the valves were closed, the pump discharge was dead-heading, pushing significant quantities of oil from the seals of the pump into the containment.

19. List typical entries found in an oil record book. When are entries required? Who must sign and review the book?

Typical entries found in the oil record book include ballasting or cleaning of fuel tanks, discharge of dirty ballast or cleaning water, collection or disposal of oil residues (sludge or otherwise), discharge overboard or disposal of bilge water which has accumulated, or bunkering of fuel or lubricating oil. For my ship, this generally included weekly sludge reports (after sounding each of the tanks), when sludge or oily waste was transferred between tanks or during bunkering. The book must be signed (initial and rate) by the operator for their respective entries and each page reviewed and signed by the master. All of our entries were first submitted in draft form to the chief engineer before the operator was allowed to write them in the ORB.

20. Provide name plate data for the oil/water separator (OWS).

The OWS was a Marinflock AB model CB 1.0 manufactured in 2006 with a max flowrate of 1000 L/hr, a service volume of 580 L. It was tested for an oil content between 0-5 ppm and has a USCG approval number of 162.050/1263/0.

![Marinflock AB oily water separator](Pictures/part9/MF_nameplate.png)

21. List and describe in detail how the oily bilge separator functions. What are the USCG requirements for oil/water separators? List the articles.

The oily bilge water separator functions by drawing a suction from the clean bilge tank. Oily water travels first through a plate type heat exchanger with steam on the other side. The water is heated to drastically increase the propensity that it will separate within the coalescing filter in the next step. In the oil descaler tank, dirty bilge water is admitted from the side and is allowed to separate via the differences in specific gravities between the oil and the water. The oil will travel to the top of the column and clean water will travel to the bottom. Once the water level in the tank reaches a high level sensor, air is forced into the tank at pressure and mixed to dissolve air into the water. As this is happening, water is continuously discharged out of the circulation tank into the flocculation tank. Flocculation is the process of adding chemicals (in this case, Flocbooster) in order to cause chemicals in suspension to clump together and come out of suspension. The flocculants added cause the oil to separate out as a "foam" on top of the tank which is skimmed off and transferred to the sludge tank. At this point, most of the oil has been removed from the sample, but now it travels through three sets of filters to improve its presentation and ensure a quality lower than 15 ppm of oil. The first filter is an oil absorber and removes any remaining clumps of oil. The next two filters are activated carbon filters which remove any other non-oil contaminants that may discolor the sample and cause the later optical sensor to misinterpret the presence of oil within the sample.

Finally, my ship had an add-on to this system which was called the OWS Whitebox. This box contained an optical sensor on the outlet of the separator filters which used the opacity of the sample to determine how many parts per million remained within the sample. After the sensor, there was a three-way valve. The now-clean bilge water enters in one side and either travels back to the clean bilge tank or the overboard discharge. This three-way valve was fail-safe, meaning that the system would only open to the overboard discharge if the oil content was below the setpoint (in our case, 5ppm), otherwise, it would continue pumping the water back into the clean bilge tank.

33 CFR § 151.360(a)(1-6) dictates the criteria for oil discharges aboard a vessel outside of 12 nautical miles of nearest land. (5-6) require that: "The oil content of the effluent without dilution is less than 15 parts per million (ppm);" and "The ship has in operation oily-water separating equipment, a bilge monitor, bilge alarm, or combination thereof..." According to section 151.10(b)(5), oily-water separators must be equipped with a, "15 ppm bilge alarm; for U.S. inspected ships, approved under 46 CFR 162.050 and for US uninspected ships and foreign ships, either approved under 46 CFR 162.050 or listed in the current International Maritime Organization (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) Circular summary of MARPOL 73/78 approved equipment."

22. Who runs the Oily Water Separator (OWS)? How often is it placed in service? What are the maintenance procedures for the OWS?

Only the chief was authorized by the company to run the oily water separator. All of the engine room duty engineers (including myself) were authorized to watch the OWS while it was running so the chief could leave, but the engine room could not remain in an unmanned status under the running of the OWS and only the chief was authorized to start the unit. The unit was only placed into service once during a training/test exercise in my time on the vessel, so very rarely. Generally, the ship pumped oily water as slops in port since it was preferable to the company to expend additional money to not separate the water themselves (given some legal troubles they were involved in several years ago over improper oily waste disposal). The chief could submit paperwork to authorize him to use the OWS. The maintenance procedures for the OWS included regularly cleaning the OWS "eye" which determined the concentration of oil within the system and cleaning and removing the water outlet pipe yearly for the Coast Guard inspection.

23. Provide name plate data for the sewage treatment unit. Explain its operation.

Evac Collecting Unit Vacuum Toilet **Type**: Easy Fit **Year**: 2006 **Serial Number**: 2829 **Inspected**: 08 08 2006 Made by Evac

The Evac vacuum collection unit operates by using vacuum pumps to pull sewage from receptacles (toilets and urinals) into a black water collection tank as described above. The two vacuum pumps on our unit pulled a vacuum on the piping system that connects to the toilets in accommodation spaces. When the flush button is pressed, the waste in your toilet is opened to the vacuum system and higher pressure atmospheric air pushes the waste into the pipes. According to the manufacturer, one flush pushes the waste about 10-20 meters but it generally takes two flushes for the waste to reach the collection tank. From there, it can be pumped out of the black water tank using a different positive displacement pump moves the waste to an overboard discharge through a series of valves, the last of which is usually chained shut. This waste can only be pumped overboard outside of 12 NM of land or special areas. There is also an inlet for fresh water nozzles which spray water to help clean the sides of the tank.
