## Daily Log

### Day 0: 5/10

This morning, I arrived to the ship after a very early flight. After spending the majority of the morning completing paperwork with the Captain, I spent the early afternoon meeting the engineers and getting a tour of the engine room. The M/V ARC Independence burns a heavy fuel distillate called very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) and, as such, it requires steam heating to reduce the viscosity of the fuel and improve atomization and flow. While there are larger steam heaters, there are steam lines that wrap around the fuel oil lines to the main engine and one of these lines was leaking causing steam condensate to drip below the line onto the deck. I assisted the engineers in performing quick temporary repairs on the line, including using pipe clamps to reduce the pressure of steam into the line and thus reducing the amount of steam that was allowed to leak out. Next, I followed the Third Assistant Engineer around as he started to perform some pre-departure checks given that the vessel was slated to leave tomorrow.

### Day 1: 5/11

The morning's work involved exercising the at-sea spares for the main engine and ship service diesel generator exhaust valves. According to the First Engineer, this maintenance is typical prior to an Atlantic crossing. After threading in a service air connection to the side of the valve body and using the chain hoist to lift the assembly, the exhaust valves were allowed to move about their full length of travel and lubricated with Never-Seez. After the valves were completed. I assisted the Third in troubleshooting some non-functional deck lighting which included replacing light bulbs and chasing bad grounds.

### Day 2: 5/12

Today's work began by shadowing the oiler on her engine room round. This round was much shorter than the TSSOM oiler round as most of the items recorded were to be measured on the computer. There were only 4 manual tank soundings. Afterwards, I assisted the 3rd Engineer on continuing the LED fog light conversion project mentioned for the previous day. This involved removing the ballast for the previous light and then rewiring the leads directly.

Ultimately, I was taken away from this project to perform an inspection on the secondary of the step-down transformer (440v to 220v) for the accommodation space and the upper car deck lighting. In this process, I learned that one cannot run two transformers in parallel because the secondaries act like two distinct sources. This was not intuitive to me. As such, it was necessary to de-energize the running starboard-side transformer before energizing the port-side transformer which meant a momentary blackout.

After that, I returned to the LED fog light conversion project where I was responsible for milling slots into the brackets for the new lights.

Finally, my day concluded with a bridge steering gear test as we were expected to go underway at 0100 (allegedly).

### Day 3: 5/13

Today, the M/V Arc Independence finally got underway. At 0800, I assumed the maneuvering watch with the Third Engineer. It involved mostly walking around the engine room, looking for leaks and checking the important temperatures and pressures. It also provided an opportunity to get familiar with the Kongsberg system. In the afternoon, it was back to maintenance. This began with the transformer that we had worked on yesterday, which was re-energized successfully with no major complications. With that being said, the transformer did create a small ground. I learned that this is due to the accumulation of moisture within the transformer. This is why it is very important to leave the transformer powered on the primary end even if the secondary is disconnected. This configuration will allow the energy stored within the field to heat up the copper windings and drive out moisture. After this, we made our way to the bow thruster compartment to take measurements on a motor that had an improperly-sized coupling installed on it.

Finally, the side vehicle bay loading door is not regularly used and the ship's crew is in the process of phasing it out due to leaking hydraulic components connected to the door. As such, I helped the first engineer remove two hydraulic cylinders from the door: one to be used as a spare and the other to be rebuilt.

### Day 4: 5/14

Today, my day began by performing a 12 month inspection of the inboard diesel oil circulating pump. It involved checking the motor current draw, observing for vibrations and checking the telltale hole for leaks. Shortly after which, I conducted the MGO/HFO changeover. Prior to conducting the changeover, I was very unfamiliar with the process. It involved turning on the fuel oil viscosity control to manual temperature control and using it to heat both the MGO and B30 (the biofuel blend we burn when traveling to Europe). Once the MGO was hot enough, you would open the valve from the B30 tank that you wanted to draw from and it would be drawn into the line and mixed in the small fuel oil return tank for the main engine just after the engine. Over time, this B30/MGO blend would transfer over over to completely B30 as the blend was burned off and replaced completely with B30. After some time, the viscosity control system would be set back to viscosity control. After that point, the third engineer taught me how to do a bilge water transfer where we transferred bilge water from the clean bilge tank after the oily water separator to the high bilge tank. This afternoon, we conducted our first fire and emergency drill and were given a scenario where the laundry room was on fire and had a safety discussion afterwards. After the conclusion of the safety meeting, the second engineer and I tested the quick closing valves for the generator fuel oil pumps. Here, I learned that there are three zones for the quick closing valves: the generators and aux boiler (which we tested today), lube oil for both the main engine and generators, and main engine fuel oil and the purifier system.

### Day 5: 5/15

This morning, my day began by helping to troubleshoot an issue with the auxiliary boiler where the boiler would pant and not switch to a low firing mode once it hit its steam pressure set point. We began by removing and replacing the solenoid valves on the fuel line to the burner as the seats on the valve were pitted. The second engineer did not believe these to be the cause of the issue, but since we had two spare solenoids, we chose to replace them anyways.

Afterwards, we tested the boiler and did not say any improvement or worsening of the existing "panting" issue. Next, we removed the burner from the burner flange, cleaned out the injector nozzle and wire brushed the diffuser plate within the boiler. Once these maintenance items were complete, we went on to test the emergency start and low water level functionality of the boiler. We observed that the float sensor for the boiler water level got stuck in the channel so this was a future maintenance item to be added. After that, I went to assist the 3rd engineer with the fog light bracket project that we started earlier this week. He had managed to break off a drill bit in the mounting holes, so the first reassigned me to the job to clean up the mess. After some careful work with the milling machine, I was able to clean up and finish the mounting bracket. This evening, I volunteered for some unpaid overtime to see the 600-hour inspection being conducted on the inboard diesel generator. Generally, the intake and exhaust valves looked fine, however, we did identify a chip in one of the cam lobes for cylinder number 4.

Additionally, the fuel oil filter was removed and cleaned. This was a cadet job.

### Day 6: 5/16

Today continued with the work I had started the day prior with the auxiliary boiler. I was instructed to oversee the boiler water testing with the second engineer. He informed me that he usually did these tests every few days when the boiler was running, but since it wasn't, the tests were conducted once a week. The tests comprised measuring total dissolved solids (TDS), boiler total alkalinity and pH. These tests closely mirrored my chemistry experience last semester, however, the tests were much simpler. Instead of complex drip titration rituals, they instead included adding a reagent to the solution and then dropping tablets into the boiler water until a color change was observed. From there, it was as simple as looking at a chart to see what the specific test value was. After that, I was informed that I would be helping the chief the following day perform an engine performance test to see where fuel efficiency could be improved. As such, I figured it would behoove me to go and find the values needed for the test on the Kongsberg and in the engine room beforehand. As the morning came to a close, the first engineer gave me my first PM (preventative maintenance) task: checking the batteries on the rolling deck equipment. Much like checking the battery voltage of a car, I had to check all of the batteries for the 24v deck lifters, deck truck and fork lift. All values were reasonable. In the afternoon, both the second and the third engineer started working on the inboard bilge and ballast pump which had a very significant leak for the prior two weeks. I played the very crucial roll of watching, staying out of the way and passing the 18mm wrench as necessary. There were still definitely some lessons to be learned here. Much like working on a car, sometimes the tasks go very easily. Other times they do not. The biggest issue for this pump was finding the correct tools. To lift the upper portion of the pump housing out of the casing, they needed to use chainfalls. Unfortunately, they could only find one set of the short chainfalls needed to connect the upper pump housing to the lower portion of the motor mount above it. To try and manage this after the mounting bolts were removed, they instead tried to use the overhead chainfalls to try and remove this pump housing to no avail. After a very extensive search on everyone's part for the missing mini chainfalls, everyone gave up and continued the the futile overhead chainfall technique. I didn't give up though. After searching for an hour and a fruitless consultation with the boatswain, I eventually discovered the missing chainfall hidden away in the corner of the purifier room on the opposite end of the machinery spaces. With the correct tools in hand, the first was able to quickly separate the upper pump housing and pump impeller from the pump.

### Day 7: 5/17

Today was the day of the chief engineer's big main engine performance test. It required the work of many of the engineers, myself included. Our first task was to collect cylinder lube oil samples for all of the cylinders to determine the average viscosity of the cylinder lube oil necessary for the test, among other important metrics. After making a significant mess and then cleaning it up (the sampling points sprayed oil everywhere), I was called to the control room to assist the chief. I learned a lot during this test, specifically, many of the more obscure pressure, temperature and flow measurements in the engine room. I also had to enter all of these values into ARC's specific performance measuring program (Teknomar) which each entry being in its own specialized format (decimal, no decimals–all for no rhyme or reason). From there, the program ran its calculations and determined a relatively small metric for improvement (0.9g/nm). Although small, this could compound to a whole tank over the span of a year. However, there were no glaringly obvious means for improvement as most of the recommendations predicted an improvement around 0.1% to 0.4% in specific fuel consumption for whatever the maintenance or replacement item was. After lunch, I spent all of the afternoon working with the third engineer performing his lube oil analysis for the sake of the test. Test items included the viscosity, water content, base number and iron testing of the fuel, but only the viscosity was necessary for the performance test. Mostly, the biggest things I learned during this testing process was how long testing lube oil actually takes. For example, each of the iron tests took 5 minutes to run after preparing the sample, which had to be prepared one at a time or the test would expire before the machine could test it. This had to be done for all 7 samples and would take at least 40 minutes, assuming we didn't mess up any of the samples and have to retest (which we did). Mostly with this testing, I was surprised at how much testing could actually be conducted in house instead of being sent off to a lab to be measured.
