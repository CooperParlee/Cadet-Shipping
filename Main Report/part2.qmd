Part 2A Main Propulsion, Diesel or Diesel Electric

1.	List and describe the main propulsion diesel engine(s) on your ship in detail including size, speed, power, cycle, type drive, reversing method, control, and the timing of events.

The Doosan MAN B&W 7S60MC-C Mk7 main propulsion diesel engine of the ARC Independence is a two-stroke single-acting direct-drive, direct reversing crosshead diesel engine rated for 21,490 BHP (15820 KW) at 105 RPM. With this engine the vessel could make 14 kts at full ahead. The total displacement was 4,753 liters. The firing order of the engine was 1-7-2-5-4-3-6.

2.	What is the designation of the main propulsion unit?	Explain its meaning (e.g. Wartsila 6L20).

The main propulsion unit was a Doosan MAN B&W 7S60MC-C Mk7. The 7 refers to the seven inline cylinders on the engine. S means a "super" long stroke. 60 refers to the cylinder diameter in centimeters and the "MC-C" refers to the engine being a compact camshaft-controlled engine model.

3.	List and describe the name plate data for the main propulsion units including any reduction gears, clutches, couplings, and/or main motors and generators.

4.	What type of governors or engine speed control devices are used on the engine?	Give their name plate data.

NOT DONE

5.	Describe operation of the overspeed protection system and how it is tested on your vessel.

6.	What differences in the plant operation/setup did you observe when entering and leaving port (at sea-maneuvering modes)?   i.e., sea suctions, type fuel oil, pressure and temperature adjustments made, extra equipment started etc.?

There were quite a few differences in plant operation between maneuvering and at-sea operation. When maneuvering, both diesel generators were running and the shaft generator was offline. The main engine used MGO instead of heavy fuel (B30 or VLSFO) when navigating near port both due to emission control areas and for reliability. The evaporator was taken offline when near port and maneuvering. The auxiliary boiler was brought online instead of the exhaust gas boiler when maneuvering into port.

7.	List and describe the fuel oil storage and transfer system.
8.	Give a full description of the fuel oil supply to the fuel injection pumps, including the purification system.
9.	Give a full description of the fuel injection system including the control and variation of the timing and metering employed.
10.	Explain the path of lube oil flow throughout the engine. How are the liners and bearings lubricated?
11.	Provide detailed specifications of the various lubrication oils used for this engine. This may be obtained from product data sheets. Give approximate consumption figures.
12.	Describe the procedure for getting the engine ready for sea, that is, ready for leaving port.
13.	Describe the external lube oil system including filters and coolers.
14.	Describe the purification, transfer, and storage system for the lube oil.
15.	Explain how to check the L.O. level. When and how often was this done? Explain how to add oil to the engine.

The main engine L.O. level was checked at the main engine lube oil head tank two levels above the engine room via a staircase on the port side. This level was checked at the beginning of the day during the oiler round or whenever any alarms for lube oil went off. Additionally, it was continuously monitored by the Kongsberg system via a sensor in the main engine system oil sump tank.

16.	What is meant by "supercharging or turbocharging"? Explain how this is accomplished on your plant.

Turbocharging and supercharging function to raise the effective scavenging pressure of the engine to increase efficiency and power of the main engine. In a turbocharger, the force due to the pressure of the exhaust gases is used to turn the blades of the turbocharger impeller. The work produced my turning this impeller is used to turn the intake-side impeller, raising the intake pressure and forcing more air into the cylinders of the engine. Turbocharging is not a parasitic draw. Supercharging is the process of using engine work to drive a blower to force air into the engine. It is considered a parasitic draw because it removes some shaft horsepower from the engine to drive the blower, however, it also increases the overall power of the engine. On the ARC Independence, the main engine was both turbocharged and supercharged. The turbo is driven by the exhaust gas and is used to force air from the surrounding engine room into the charge air cooler.

After the charge air cooler are electrically-driven auxiliary blowers. These can further increase the scavenge air pressure going into the engine but are not entirely necessary to the operation of the plant except in conditions with little exhaust gas pressure when the engine is not at high enough speed (such as maneuvering).

17.	Give a full description of the complete cooling water system, including any seawater or Closed Fresh Water circuits.
18.	Fully describe the starting system equipment and its operation.

Starting with the compressors, the two Sperre HV2 compressors kept the two Kumkang 7,000L start air reservoirs pressurized to 30 bar.

19.	What is "tappet clearance” or “valve lash" and how is it adjusted on the intake/exhaust valves?
20.	List and describe in detail any maintenance or repairs performed on the main engine while you were on board.
 
21.	List and describe the air compressors on your ship, including their type, number, size, pressures, and what the air is used for.

For the main engine start air, there are two Sperre HV2 4-cylinder V-type reciprocating compressors with a capacity of 250 $m^3/hr$ rated for a pressure of 30 bar. The compressed air is used for starting the main engine.

There is also a much smaller Sperre HL2/77 2-cylinder V-type reciprocating compressor rated at 20 $m^3/hr$ at 30 bar used for producing start air for the diesel generators during the event of a plant blackout. This compressor is the only one on the emergency bus.

The last air compressor was the Atlas Copco GA37FF screw-type working air compressor rated for 7.1 $m^3/hr$ at 7.5 bar. It also provided control air after that air traveled through a drier. It is important to note that the chief on my vessel chose to use the crossover from the start air lines to provide control air because he felt that it provided higher capacity, but the previous chief felt that control air should be provided by the working air compressor.

22.	If the main engines could be controlled from the bridge, list in order the process of transferring control from engine control room to bridge. List precautions.
23.	List and describe the procedure to transfer main engine control from control room to the emergency position at the engine maneuvering stand or local operating panel. List any precautions to be taken during this evolution.

In order to transfer engine control from ECR to the local operating panel, first the engine control selector switch must be in "C/R Control" instead of "Bridge Control" in the engine control room. 

24.	What is the viscosity of the fuels used on board? Was the injection viscosity controlled? If so, explain this process.

The Independence burned MGO, VLSFO and B30 biofuel. The viscosity of MGO at 40\deg C was determined via lab testing to be 3.3 cSt. The viscosities for VLSFO and B30 at 50\deg C are 171.4 cSt and 57 cSt respectively. At 100\deg C, they are 21.4 cSt and 10.7 cSt respectively. Given the low viscosity of MGO, the injection viscosity was not controlled. However, with the high viscosities for VLSFO and B30, these injection viscosities were controlled electronically with the Alfa Laval OPrem system. This system measured the viscosity and temperature of the fuel oil going to the engine and adjusted the amount of steam going to the fuel oil heaters. When switching to and from MGO and a residual fuel, the temperature was controlled manually by the OPrem system, not the viscosity. This was because the MGO was not to be heated above 85\degC. 

The only time the engineers really had to manually adjust the OPrem system was when they were changing from a heavy fuel to diesel fuel. To adjust the system, they would slowly increase or decrease (for switching to or from a heavy fuel, respectively) the manual temperature setpoint on the system in increments of 5-10\degC so as not to cause the system to go into a thermal runaway alarm. They found that the system would go into this runaway alarm if they explicitly set the final setpoint because the system felt it was not reaching that temperature fast enough and would raise an alarm. As such, the engineers learned to manually adjust the system in times of changeover.
