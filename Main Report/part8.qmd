## Part 8 Fresh Water Generating Plants/Supply Systems (All Vessels)

1.	For ships equipped with evaporators (such as Nyrex or flash type), describe how sea water is pumped into the evaporator, how the water level is maintained, how heat for the evaporator is provided, what the operating pressure is in the evaporator shell, and how the shell is protected against excess pressure.

Sea water is pumped into the evaporator from the main sea water system. It would draw water from whatever sea chest was open at that time and pumped through several strainers before it reached the evaporator. The water level is maintained by the ejector pump which pulls fresh water out of the Nyrex as it condenses in addition to maintaining the vacuum. The heat for the evaporator is provided by the main engine jacket water system (or the "HT" loop as it was called on my ship). The shell pressure was maintained between 70 MPa and 85 MPa. The shell is protected against excess pressure during standard operation by maintaining pressure and temperature electronically using the control system on the Nyrex. However, in events where that control system is not able to regulate the pressure and the shell becomes overpressurized, there is a pressure relief valve on the shell of the Nyrex which discharges excess pressure to the engine room.

2.	Provide a detailed report on the starting and operating procedures for each type of fresh water generating plant (reverse osmosis/evaporator/distilling unit) on board.

The first step for starting up the Nyrex unit was to check the dosing tank levels. If the dosing tank was low, the engineers would full the tank and add 0.25 liters of Vaptreat. Then, they would check the ejector skin valve is open immediately after the ejector pump. While down on the lower level of the engine room, the inlet valves to the freshwater tank to be filled (either port or starboard) should be opened. After that, write down the water meter to add to the logbook and to the whiteboard. That way they can track how much water was moved to the respective tank. Next, slowly open the saltwater inlet and outlets at the same time, then close the vacuum breaker line. Return to the lower level of the engine room and start the ejector pump, then return to the Nyrex and watch the vacuum start to build. Open the valve from the dosing tank and start the dosing meter to 60-70cc/min. Open the outlet valve from the UV treatment light (Benrad). Open the drain line from the freshwater pump. Ensure that the jacket water bypass is fully open. Next, slowly open the jacket water inlet and outlet valves completely. With the jacket water inlet valves open, the bypass can now slowly be closed partially to the half-way open chalk mark on the side of the valve. Now, slowly close the salt water bypass. Start the freshwater pump just below the Nyrex and watch the salinity drop. When the salinity is below 7ppm, turn the salinometer on. Verify the proper lineup to the tank to be filled, then open the discharge of the freshwater pump to the UV treatment light and close the freshwater drain valve (assuming salinity of the water is low enough). Finally, make a quick round around the unit to ensure it is running well and there are no leaks then adjust the logbook. The Kongsberg system will not detect changes in the pump operation due to an issue after shipyard, so the pump status must be manually adjusted in the Kongsberg system so that high salinity measurements will produce an error in the Kongsberg system. Go into the "Pump Overview" screen and right-click the evaporator freshwater pump, "Properties" and then "Invert Input." The pump should now be reflecting as running. Be sure to undo this when turning the evaporator off. From there, operation is simple: monitor the tank level indicator on the Kongsberg system periodically, it's a large tank, so it will take a while to fill up. Additionally, be aware of salinity alarms that might arise on the Kongsberg system.

3.	What chemicals are used to treat the seawater feed to the water generating plants and what is the purpose of these chemicals?

The Nyrex system used a chemical called Vaptreat. This chemical was marketed as an all-in-one evaporator treatment chemical and was owned by the parent company Wilhelmsen. Allegedly, it is a scale-prevention additive and an anti-foaming additive. The scale prevention prevents the ions in the salt water from settling out onto the heat exchange surfaces and reducing heat exchanger effectiveness. This increases the amount of time between evaporator cleanings. The anti-foaming additives prevent the salt water from foaming up and potentially carrying over as bubbles into the distillate. This reduces the chances of the presence of bacteria and the solute concentration in the distillate. 

4.	Describe the operation of the salinity cells and dump valve. What is the maximum salinity allowed in the water produced in each type of freshwater generator? What actions would you take if it was exceeded?

Salinity cells are basic conductivity meters that measure the amount of ions (salt) in the water. With more salt in solution, there are more liberated ions which makes the solution more conductive when a voltage is applied to the salinity cell. The maximum salinity allowed in our Nyrex freshwater generator was 7ppm before the system would raise an alarm in the Kongsburg. If we had an RO unit, this would be much higher, probably 500 ppm, but it depends on the unit and the pressures involved. If the ppm content in our Nyrex exceeded the threshold, I would first check the level in the additive tank. If the levels of Vaptreat, an anti-foaming additive, were too high, it could cause salt water carryover in the form of bubbles in the foam. Next, I would make sure that the Nyrex was not sending water to any of the freshwater tanks, but the urgency of this would depend on the ppm that was being measured by the salinity cell. I would also check the jacket water inlet temperature. If it was too low, we might have trouble making steam to distill. I would also compare it to the outlet temperature. If there was a low temperature differential, there is a large chance that the unit is scaled up and not adequately transferring heat to the saltwater. Over time, I would also look for trends. If this was a recurring theme, I would start to worry about saltwater leakage and a failed/fouled salinity probe. 

5.	What maintenance is periodically performed on each type of fresh water generating plant?

Maintenance on the evaporator includes periodic descaling with a chemical called Descale-X which helps improve the thermal conductivity of the plates and hence the efficiency of the unit. This was only performed on the salt water side with the inlet and outlet of the salt water lines both closed. Over the long term, the Nyrex is disassembled and the plates are inspected for fouling and integrity, and these plates are further cleaned manually. This maintenance was not performed while I was on board as the evaporator was our only means of water generation, so this maintenance was only performed in shipyard. The salinity probe is regularly removed and tested, however, this system was relatively reliable. The control system is opened and inspected for chafed wires and other damaged components.

6.	For ships equipped with Reverse Osmosis plant, describe is operation and maintenance. Provide operating pressures, number of stages, type of pump(s) used, post treatment if any, type filtration if any, anti-scalant dosage, and backwash operation if used.

Since my vessel was not equipped with a reverse osmosis plant, I am unable to speak to the specifics of my vessel. Generally, reverse osmosis plants operate by using a high pressure pump to produce high pressures at the surface of a fairly large membrane. The pores in the membrane are large enough to let water through, but small enough and polarized to not allow ions (salt) to travel through the membrane. As such, permeate (fresh water with much lower salinity) accumulates on the opposite end of the membrane leaving behind a much saltier water on the other side called brine. An RO plant will generally operate between 25 to 65 bar and as such will require a high-pressure pump (such as a piston or multi-staged centrifugal pump). The output of the water must receive some sort of post treatment such as UV sterilization or chlorination/bromination as the water has not reached temperatures that are safe to drink. It is generally necessary to use a fine filter before the RO unit because debris can damage the membrane and this filter should be backwashed to prevent debris from migrating through the filter and risking damage to the RO membrane. Additionally, since this water from the RO unit produces permeate to a relatively high concentration of solutes, an anti-scalant must be added if it is to be used as makeup water for equipment. This is less of an issue for use as potable water.

7.	How is potable water treated prior to consumption?

Potable water originates in the Nyrex as distilled water. From the Nyrex, it is run through one set of UV sterilizers before it is sent to the fresh water tanks. After being produced by the Nyrex, most of the minerals from the water have been removed, so the water is not drinkable for long periods of time. As such, the water must be remineralized. To do this, water is pumped from the fresh water tanks and then travels through both an activated carbon filter, then through a rehardening filter. With the minerals restored, the water travels through another set of two UV sterilizers before it is sent to the accommodation spaces for drinking.

8.	What actions did watch/duty engineers take to maintain proper freshwater production?

My vessel was highly automated so we only had duty engineers. Given the level of automation on this system, very few steps had to be taken to maintain freshwater production. To make sure we had adequate freshwater reserves, duty engineers would run the Nyrex pretty much continuously for our Atlantic crossing to fill up both the port and starboard fresh water tanks. The only steps they would take would be to check the treatment tank at the beginning of the day and add Vaptreat as necessary but the feed of this into the system was regulated by a dosing pump next to the Nyrex. The system would automatically alarm if the concentration of the solution exceeded 5ppm and the engineers would have to go dump that water to the bilge via a set of manually-actuated valves. Additionally, the system would alarm if the photocell in the UV sterilizers detected that no UV light was being produced but this did not happen while I was on the vessel. As needed, the Nyrex would be de-scaled with Descalex (also by the parent company Wilhelmsen) after it was isolated from the system, but this did not happen while I was on the vessel.

9.	Briefly describe the types and list the capacities of the various water tanks on your ship.

There were two fresh water tanks, one on port and starboard, each with a capacity of 137.1 $m^3$ of freshwater. These acted as storage for the domestic potable water system, which had one tank, which the engineers called the "hydrophore" tank (pressurized potable water tank) which had a capacity of 2.5 $m^3$. There was also a service and technical water tank, used as makeup water for the boiler and jacket water systems, with a capacity of 12.3 $m^3$. This tank contained water which was heavily deionized in comparison to the standard freshwater system which was remineralized by the rehardening filter on the inlet to the potable water system.
