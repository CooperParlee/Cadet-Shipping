## Part 4 Electrical (All Vessels)

1.	Provide a detailed explanation of how a generator is started and then paralleled to the electrical bus.
2.	List the electrical generator name plate data and the number of units.
3.	How are the lighting circuits supplied with power?
4.	What signals/causes the emergency generator to start during an emergency? Does it start automatically? How is it secured? Describe in detail.
5.	What prevents the emergency generator switchboard from paralleling with the main bus during normal operation?
6.	What equipment protects the ship's lighting circuits, power circuits and generators from overloads, low voltage, etc.?
7.	How are vital and non-vital circuits differentiated/identified on your ship? How are nonvital loads removed from the bus if needed?
8.	List and describe the method used to clean generator internal components and/or electric motors. Ensure you include a full description of how you would perform lockout/tagout for this maintenance.
9.	Give a detailed list of what you would check when inspecting a generating set aboard your ship while standing watch at sea. Be sure to include information on the prime mover as well as the electrical generator.
10.	What is a "reverse power" trip? Where is it located, and how often is it tested? List and describe its operating principle.
11.	Provide a list of your ship’s equipment that uses batteries for backup or starting. What type of batteries are they? What routine maintenance is done on them?
12.	With reference to generators, what is "excitation"?	How were the generators “excited”?
13.	What class of insulation was used on the generators? What is meant by "megger testing", and what are satisfactory test results? What were the most recent results on your ship?
