## Part 4 Electrical (All Vessels)

1.	Provide a detailed explanation of how a generator is started and then paralleled to the electrical bus.

Generally, a diesel generator was started automatically by the Kongsberg load management program with minimal intervention from the engineers. It could be manually started from the Kongsberg screen by clicking on the generator and clicking connect. However, to manually connect a generator, it could be connected from the Main Switchboard Room. First, you must switch the control mode for the generator to local control. Next, pull out and turn the generator start switch to the start position and listen for the sound of the generator starting up. Once it is started, the switch can be disengaged. Now, go to the bus panel and select the generator you want to start up from the synchroscope menu. Adjust the governor speed from that panel for the generator you want to add to the bus such that the lights are moving "slow in the fast direction." Then, 3 minutes to midnight, pull out the generator bus tie switch and turn it to the closed position (praying is optional here). If you did everything right, the generator should be connected to the grid, but it is not really sharing the load. Grab the governor speed switches for the generators that are on the bus. Turn the switch to the generator that was previously on the bus to the lower position while raising the new generator. Keep a careful eye on the frequency of the bus and then adjust the speed as necessary to ensure that it stays as close to 60.0 Hz as possible. Continue this process until the loads on the two generators are roughly even, you can tell by looking at the the two ammeters for the respective generators.

2.	List the electrical generator name plate data and the number of units.

Our primary generator at full sailing speed was a Taiyo SIGW95DL-18 separately excited A.C. shaft generator, capable of producing 1140A at 420 V. It was a 3-phase, 18-pole generator with an excitation voltage of 181 V, drawing an excitation current of 120 A. The amature and field insulation were both class-F rated and could be safely operated up to 104 \degC. This generator was IP44 rated and weighed 4700 kilograms. We had one of these.

We had two Hyundai synchronous generators on our two diesel gensets of type HFJ7 638-84K. They were rated for 450 V, 2726 A at 60 Hz at 900 RPM. They had a power factor of 0.8 and were excited by 75 VDC at 7.0 A. They also had a single-phase space heater that drew 630 W at 220 V.

3.	How are the lighting circuits supplied with power?

Since my vessel was a Korean-built, formerly Swedish-operated vessel, the vessel's electrical circuits are designed to run on 440v and 220v. The ship's diesel generators and shaft generator produce 440v 60Hz electricity (yes, even though it was a European ship). This electricity travels through a step-down transformer to 220v to provide power to the electrical lighting circuits. There were two of these such transformers for the accommodation spaces located within the $CO_2$ room. Some lights were powered both by the main bus or by the emergency bus. There was a separate 220v step down transformer in the emergency generator room.

4.	What signals/causes the emergency generator to start during an emergency? Does it start automatically? How is it secured? Describe in detail.

The emergency generator is triggered by sensors in the main switchboard which monitor both the frequency and voltage of the main service diesel engines. If the frequency is too high or low, or the voltage of the generators is too low, the emergency diesel generator is sent a signal to start automatically. This signal must be sent within 45 seconds of the loss of power, according to the Coast Guard. For us, although the engine was incredibly reliable and started quickly, this delay was set for 30 seconds. This was because the backup batteries for the Kongsberg control system would automatically try to run its blackout recovery operation, which would systematically attempt to start both of the diesel generators well before the 30 seconds were reached. Assuming this isn't the case, the generator detects a lack of power on the main bus after 30 seconds and kicks on using the stored electrical system of the EDG. The system comprises 2, 12v lead acid automotive-style batteries which drive an electric starting motor to start the engine. The motor spins up to speed, then a Bendix-drive gear engages with the flywheel gear of the engine. Once the engine's speed is faster than that of the starter, the Bendix is centrifugally disengaged from the flywheel gear. The emergency diesel generator is automatically secured when the system detects power on the main bus. The emergency generator will then disconnect itself from the emergency bus and begin a cooldown cycle before returning to standby mode. In an emergency situation, the EDG can be secured manually by pushing the emergency stop or a separate off button on the EDG controller. However, if the off button is pressed and the operating mode is not shifted from auto to manual, the EDG will just try to restart itself in 30 seconds as long as main power is not restored.

5.	What prevents the emergency generator switchboard from paralleling with the main bus during normal operation?

Normal operation for my vessel dictates the use of the Kongsberg electrical load management system. The emergency diesel generator is not managed by the Kongsberg load system and as such will not automatically be paralleled with the main bus. Further, an interconnecting-bus tie breaker is what connects the main bus to the emergency bus. This bus will open if there is a power loss on the main bus. That way, the emergency generator will only power things on the emergency bus but when the bus is closed in normal operation, emergency bus items can still be powered off of the main bus.

6.	What equipment protects the ship's lighting circuits, power circuits and generators from overloads, low voltage, etc.?
7.	How are vital and non-vital circuits differentiated/identified on your ship? How are nonvital loads removed from the bus if needed?

Vital and non-vital circuits on my ship are separated onto separate buses: an emergency bus and main bus respectively. Ordinarily, these buses are connected by a interconnecting-bus tie, except for when main power is lost, in which case, non-essential equipment such as the sauna, non-emergency lights, outlets, cargo ventilation fans, etc are disconnected from the power supplied by the emergency generator. Non-vital loads can also be removed from the bus by opening the breaker for the piece of equipment in the respective switchboard or via the Kongsberg automation, to some extent. However, to fully remove a load from the bus, the specific switchboard breaker panel is the optimum place for total isolation.

8.	What is a "reverse power" trip? Where is it located, and how often is it tested? List and describe its operating principle.

A reverse power trip is designed to disconnect a generator from the grid when it senses power is traveling to the generator (motorizing it) instead of the other way around. Motorization can severely damage a motor if the generator and grid frequencies do not line up because the generator, now a motor, will physically pull the generator, even if that means twisting the shaft, throwing the generator out of timing, etc. Functionally, a reverse power trip monitors the power output of a generator and trips if it reaches a value that is too low. Our overspeed trip was located in the main switchboard room and was tested quarterly by manually reducing the governor for the motor until the trip disconnected the generator.

9.	With reference to generators, what is "excitation"?	How were the generators “excited”?

Excitation is the production of a magnetic field by applying direct current to the generator rotor windings. It is the rotation of these fields around the stator windings that induces alternating current in these stator windings. Excitation is very important because it determines the output voltage on the generator. On my ship, we had two types of generators. We had the shaft generator and the diesel generators, which were both separately excited, meaning the generator excitor was powered by an external supply that was regulated by an automatic voltage regulator (AVR) to control the output AC voltage from the generator.

10.	What is meant by "megger testing", and what are satisfactory test results? What were the most recent results on your ship?

"Megging" refers to the use of an insulation testing device which I regularly used aboard my vessel. It was an incredibly invaluable troubleshooting tool. Basically, a megger checks the resistance between a wire and ground via its insulation. I usually used the 500v setting on the megger I was issued as the ship's systems were generally 440v. For that setting, a satisfactory result was considered greater than 550 M\Omega, the range of the meter. However, anything over 150 M\Omega was considered suboptimal, but of low concern. We actively tried to fix values less than 100 M\Omega. The most recent comprehensive test performed on the vessel was over the entirety of the cargo bay ventilation fans, of which were were approximately 60. About 90% of these fans received values over 550 M\Omega and only 2 received values less than 100 M\Omega: fan 5-4 received a value of 80 M\Omega and fan 2-4 received a value of 0.2 M\Omega.
