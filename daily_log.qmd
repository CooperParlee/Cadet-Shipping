## Daily Log

### Day 0: 5/10

Location: Loading cargo in Baltimore

This morning, I arrived to the ship after a very early flight. After spending the majority of the morning completing paperwork with the Captain, I spent the early afternoon meeting the engineers and getting a tour of the engine room. The M/V ARC Independence burns a heavy fuel distillate called very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) and, as such, it requires steam heating to reduce the viscosity of the fuel and improve atomization and flow. While there are larger steam heaters, there are steam lines that wrap around the fuel oil lines to the main engine and one of these lines was leaking causing steam condensate to drip below the line onto the deck. I assisted the engineers in performing quick temporary repairs on the line, including using pipe clamps to reduce the pressure of steam into the line and thus reducing the amount of steam that was allowed to leak out. Next, I followed the Third Assistant Engineer around as he started to perform some pre-departure checks given that the vessel was slated to leave tomorrow.

### Day 1: 5/11

Location: Loading cargo in Baltimore

The morning's work involved exercising the at-sea spares for the main engine and ship service diesel generator exhaust valves. According to the First Engineer, this maintenance is typical prior to an Atlantic crossing. After threading in a service air connection to the side of the valve body and using the chain hoist to lift the assembly, the exhaust valves were allowed to move about their full length of travel and lubricated with Never-Seez. After the valves were completed. I assisted the Third in troubleshooting some non-functional deck lighting which included replacing light bulbs and chasing bad grounds.

### Day 2: 5/12

Location: Loading cargo in Baltimore

Today's work began by shadowing the oiler on her engine room round. This round was much shorter than the TSSOM oiler round as most of the items recorded were to be measured on the computer. There were only 4 manual tank soundings. Afterwards, I assisted the 3rd Engineer on continuing the LED fog light conversion project mentioned for the previous day. This involved removing the ballast for the previous light and then rewiring the leads directly.

![Note: Foglight ballasts after they are removed from the control box](Pictures/log/day2/ballasts_removed.png)

![Note: Empty control box with "straight piped" LED light feeder lines](Pictures/log/day2/ballasts_removed2.png)

Ultimately, I was taken away from this project to perform an inspection on the secondary of the step-down transformer (440v to 220v) for the accommodation space and the upper car deck lighting. In this process, I learned that one cannot run two transformers in parallel because the secondaries act like two distinct sources. This was not intuitive to me. As such, it was necessary to de-energize the running starboard-side transformer before energizing the port-side transformer which meant a momentary blackout. 

![Note: Secondary stepdown transformer](Pictures/log/day2/transformer.png)

After that, I returned to the LED fog light conversion project where I was responsible for milling slots into the brackets for the new lights. 

![Lighting bracket after milling is concluded](Pictures/log/day2/lighting_brack.png)

Finally, my day concluded with a bridge steering gear test as we were expected to go underway at 0100 (allegedly).

### Day 3: 5/13

Location: Underway from Baltimore

Today, the M/V Arc Independence finally got underway. At 0800, I assumed the maneuvering watch with the Third Engineer. It involved mostly walking around the engine room, looking for leaks and checking the important temperatures and pressures. It also provided an opportunity to get familiar with the Kongsberg system. In the afternoon, it was back to maintenance. This began with the transformer that we had worked on yesterday, which was re-energized successfully with no major complications. With that being said, the transformer did create a small ground. I learned that this is due to the accumulation of moisture within the transformer. This is why it is very important to leave the transformer powered on the primary end even if the secondary is disconnected. This configuration will allow the energy stored within the field to heat up the copper windings and drive out moisture. After this, we made our way to the bow thruster compartment to take measurements on a motor that had an improperly-sized coupling installed on it.

![Note: Steering gear oil pump inspected](Pictures/log/day3/strg_pump.png)

Finally, the side vehicle bay loading door is not regularly used and the ship's crew is in the process of phasing it out due to leaking hydraulic components connected to the door. As such, I helped the first engineer remove two hydraulic cylinders from the door: one to be used as a spare and the other to be rebuilt.

### Day 4: 5/14

Location: Underway in Atlantic Ocean

Today, my day began by performing a 12 month inspection of the inboard diesel oil circulating pump. It involved checking the motor current draw, observing for vibrations and checking the telltale hole for leaks. Shortly after which, I conducted the MGO/HFO changeover. Prior to conducting the changeover, I was very unfamiliar with the process. It involved turning on the fuel oil viscosity control to manual temperature control and using it to heat both the MGO and B30 (the biofuel blend we burn when traveling to Europe). Once the MGO was hot enough, you would open the valve from the B30 tank that you wanted to draw from and it would be drawn into the line and mixed in the small fuel oil return tank for the main engine just after the engine. Over time, this B30/MGO blend would transfer over over to completely B30 as the blend was burned off and replaced completely with B30. After some time, the viscosity control system would be set back to viscosity control. After that point, the third engineer taught me how to do a bilge water transfer where we transferred bilge water from the clean bilge tank after the oily water separator to the high bilge tank. This afternoon, we conducted our first fire and emergency drill and were given a scenario where the laundry room was on fire and had a safety discussion afterwards. After the conclusion of the safety meeting, the second engineer and I tested the quick closing valves for the generator fuel oil pumps. Here, I learned that there are three zones for the quick closing valves: the generators and aux boiler (which we tested today), lube oil for both the main engine and generators, and main engine fuel oil and the purifier system.

### Day 5: 5/15

Location: Underway in Atlantic Ocean

This morning, my day began by helping to troubleshoot an issue with the auxiliary boiler where the boiler would pant and not switch to a low firing mode once it hit its steam pressure set point. We began by removing and replacing the solenoid valves on the fuel line to the burner as the seats on the valve were pitted. The second engineer did not believe these to be the cause of the issue, but since we had two spare solenoids, we chose to replace them anyways. 

![Note: boiler solenoid piping rebuilt with new solenoid housings.](Pictures/log/day5/rebuilt_boiler_solenoid.png)

Afterwards, we tested the boiler and did not say any improvement or worsening of the existing "panting" issue. Next, we removed the burner from the burner flange, cleaned out the injector nozzle and wire brushed the diffuser plate within the boiler. Once these maintenance items were complete, we went on to test the emergency start and low water level functionality of the boiler. We observed that the float sensor for the boiler water level got stuck in the channel so this was a future maintenance item to be added. After that, I went to assist the 3rd engineer with the fog light bracket project that we started earlier this week. He had managed to break off a drill bit in the mounting holes, so the first reassigned me to the job to clean up the mess. After some careful work with the milling machine, I was able to clean up and finish the mounting bracket. This evening, I volunteered for some unpaid overtime to see the 600-hour inspection being conducted on the inboard diesel generator. Generally, the intake and exhaust valves looked fine, however, we did identify a chip in one of the cam lobes for cylinder number 4.

![Note: cylinder 4 cam lobe chip identified.](Pictures/log/day5/cam_chip.png)

Additionally, the fuel oil filter was removed and cleaned. This was a cadet job.

### Day 6: 5/16

Location: Underway in Atlantic Ocean

Today continued with the work I had started the day prior with the auxiliary boiler. I was instructed to oversee the boiler water testing with the second engineer. He informed me that he usually did these tests every few days when the boiler was running, but since it wasn't, the tests were conducted once a week. The tests comprised measuring total dissolved solids (TDS), boiler total alkalinity and pH. These tests closely mirrored my chemistry experience last semester, however, the tests were much simpler. Instead of complex drip titration rituals, they instead included adding a reagent to the solution and then dropping tablets into the boiler water until a color change was observed. From there, it was as simple as looking at a chart to see what the specific test value was. After that, I was informed that I would be helping the chief the following day perform an engine performance test to see where fuel efficiency could be improved. As such, I figured it would behoove me to go and find the values needed for the test on the Kongsberg and in the engine room beforehand. As the morning came to a close, the first engineer gave me my first PM (preventative maintenance) task: checking the batteries on the rolling deck equipment. Much like checking the battery voltage of a car, I had to check all of the batteries for the 24v deck lifters, deck truck and fork lift. All values were reasonable. In the afternoon, both the second and the third engineer started working on the inboard bilge and ballast pump which had a very significant leak for the prior two weeks. I played the very crucial roll of watching, staying out of the way and passing the 18mm wrench as necessary. There were still definitely some lessons to be learned here. Much like working on a car, sometimes the tasks go very easily. Other times they do not. The biggest issue for this pump was finding the correct tools. To lift the upper portion of the pump housing out of the casing, they needed to use chainfalls. Unfortunately, they could only find one set of the short chainfalls needed to connect the upper pump housing to the lower portion of the motor mount above it. To try and manage this after the mounting bolts were removed, they instead tried to use the overhead chainfalls to try and remove this pump housing to no avail. After a very extensive search on everyone's part for the missing mini chainfalls, everyone gave up and continued the the futile overhead chainfall technique. I didn't give up though. After searching for an hour and a fruitless consultation with the boatswain, I eventually discovered the missing chainfall hidden away in the corner of the purifier room on the opposite end of the machinery spaces. With the correct tools in hand, the first was able to quickly separate the upper pump housing and pump impeller from the pump.

### Day 7: 5/17

Location: Underway in Atlantic Ocean

Today was the day of the chief engineer's big main engine performance test. It required the work of many of the engineers, myself included. Our first task was to collect cylinder lube oil samples for all of the cylinders to determine the average viscosity of the cylinder lube oil necessary for the test, among other important metrics. After making a significant mess and then cleaning it up (the sampling points sprayed oil everywhere), I was called to the control room to assist the chief. I learned a lot during this test, specifically, many of the more obscure pressure, temperature and flow measurements in the engine room. I also had to enter all of these values into ARC's specific performance measuring program (Teknomar) which each entry being in its own specialized format (decimal, no decimals–all for no rhyme or reason). From there, the program ran its calculations and determined a relatively small metric for improvement (0.9g/nm). Although small, this could compound to a whole tank over the span of a year. However, there were no glaringly obvious means for improvement as most of the recommendations predicted an improvement around 0.1% to 0.4% in specific fuel consumption for whatever the maintenance or replacement item was. After lunch, I spent all of the afternoon working with the third engineer performing his lube oil analysis for the sake of the test. Test items included the viscosity, water content, base number and iron testing of the fuel, but only the viscosity was necessary for the performance test. Mostly, the biggest things I learned during this testing process was how long testing lube oil actually takes. For example, each of the iron tests took 5 minutes to run after preparing the sample, which had to be prepared one at a time or the test would expire before the machine could test it. This had to be done for all 7 samples and would take at least 40 minutes, assuming we didn't mess up any of the samples and have to retest (which we did). Mostly with this testing, I was surprised at how much testing could actually be conducted in house instead of being sent off to a lab to be measured.

### Day 8: 5/18

Location: Underway in Atlantic Ocean

Sundays are generally "days off" for the engineers where they work an abbreviated day and often do safety-related tasks. The company decided that Sundays are largely days for cadets to work on projects. As such, I spent most of the day working on that. However, during the afternoon, I had the opportunity to clean and replace the central sea water strainer for the LT cooling loop. 

![Note: LT/Central Sea Water heat exchanger](Pictures/log/day8/heat_ex_sw.PNG)

First, we had to remove the sealing flange and drain the heat exchanger, but not too quickly because that might cause the containment below to overflow. With the heat exchanger drained, we could completely remove the strainer bolts and remove the strainer basket. From there, it was just a couple of taps to get some of the accumulated gunk to fall out of the exchanger (we would end up needing to use the sink to really clean it). Then, a big scraping brush would be used to clean the ocean detritus from the edges of the plates before the exchanger was backflushed to clean out more gunk. From there, we installed a new strainer basket that had been modified to better fit within the exchanger and reinstalled the mounting plates.

![Note: Strainer basket removed](Pictures/log/day8/strainer_rem.PNG) 

### Day 9: 5/19
Location: Underway in Atlantic Ocean

After an easier day yesterday, it was back to work today. My morning began by doing a continuation of the battery testing that I started on day 6. Instead of measuring the voltages of the batteries, I instead connected an inductive load to the battery (called the load tester) and measured the battery voltage while loaded.

![Note: Battery load tester "electric cheese grater"](Pictures/log/day9/electric_cheese_grater.PNG)

Afterwards, all of the engineers received training on both the oily water separator (OWS) and how to start up the plant after a blackout. Apparently, the Independence is so automated that it can basically start up most of the plant independently, pun intended. Still, we went back to basics and both the third engineer and I had the opportunity to manually start the generators and parallel them with the bus. As far as the oily water separator goes, the chief engineer pulled me aside and gave me a full rundown on OWS operation and really dispelled many fears about the system. I learned that it is the addition of significant heat that causes the oil and the water to separate. In the afternoon, the third engineer and I load tested both of the generators and compiled Teknomar reports to submit to the company. My responsibility was to measure and record the fuel rack setting after he measured the peak combustion pressure for that specific cylinder. 

![Note: fuel rack index](Pictures/log/day9/ae_fuel_rack_index.PNG)

![Note: fuel rack index (close up)](Pictures/log/day9/ae_rack_close.PNG)

After which point, we used pulverized walnuts to clean the exhaust gas turbocharger turbine and water to clean the intake side.

### Day 10: 5/20
Location: Underway in Atlantic Ocean
Today my work began with the first of what is expected to be my regular morning round. My first wanted me to get into the routine of doing a morning round for when I get my 3rd's license. Mostly, this round consisted of walking around the engine room, looking for leaks, and seeing what's running with an emphasis on the third engineer's systems like sewage, stern tube, the main engine and the important head tanks (M/E lube oil and jacket water). This went by fairly quickly because the first engineer wanted to get started on the acid wash for the central salt water heat exchanger that we cleaned yesterday. After mixing a tank of gross pink Scale-X and water, we connected it up to the heat exchanger via a diaphragm pump and left it running for about an hour. 

After that, it was time to do the biannual EDG inspection and testing of EDG safety trips. Below is a list of items that we checked:
- Generator windings and cables
- General cleaning
- Electrical connections
- Bearings
- Space heater function
- Oil

As far as the safety trips, we tested the overspeed trip and alarm, high cooling water temperature, low cooling water pressure, lube oil high temperature and low pressure, and the start failure alarm.

In the afternoon, I was sent off on my own to use the megger to test about sixty control boxes for cargo ventilation fans to hunt down the source of a ground. This comprised the bulk of my afternoon and I did not finish this today. Perhaps the biggest learning experiences for me today are that you don't have to intrinsically know when maintenance on machinery is to be done, the computer will pretty much tell you. I also learned what a monotonous pain megging is. I guess that is why it is "a cadet job."

![Cargo vent fan that failed the megging test given a value of 0.2 M\Omega](Pictures/log/day10/bad_meg.PNG)

### Day 11: 5/21

Location: Underway in Atlantic Ocean

Today, I began my day by resuming yesterday's grand megging project. Fortunately, I managed to meg all of the ventilation fans before 11 and I was able to determine the source of the ground fault. I definitely learned how useful a tool megging can be to identify problems within the electrical system. After that, I assisted the first engineer in testing the Hyper Mist fire suppression system over the inboard diesel generator. Using the fire testing wand (a tool that resembles a transparent plunger with a can attached to the stick) and a UV flashlight, we triggered both of the required zones to automatically trigger the system and tested that the mist would be properly admitted from the nozzles above the generator. After disabling the alarm, we proceeded to the fire control room (fire locker A) and manually tested that the system could be started from there. 

In the afternoon, we had a fire and oil spill drill and received instructions on fire control if it is to happen while bunkering because we are nearing our European bunkering port of Antwerp. After that, I spent the remainder of the afternoon producing mounting brackets for the LED fog light conversions.

### Day 12: 5/22

Location: Underway near Scotland

This morning began with a very long MGO fuel change. Our ship was about to begin transiting into a European emissions control area as we passed by Scotland. As such, we had to change over from B30 (a heavy fuel with higher sulfur) to diesel. Much like our fuel change earlier in the trip as we left the United States, we had to line up several valves such that the fuel traveled into the mixing tank and slowly diluted the concentration of the higher sulfur heavy fuel. When we switched over to B30, we did not have to really worry about sulfur content because our sulfur-oxide output was not being controlled as we weren't in an ECA anymore. However, with this section of the voyage, we had to make sure we transferred over from B30 to diesel with adequate time for the B30 sulfur residuals to be burned off before we reached the emissions control area. To do this, the chief had an Excel sheet where we plugged in engine speed, underway speed and distance to the ECA, B30 sulfur content and MGO sulfur content, and the sheet would give you a time to initiate the transfer in order to make sure your sulfur oxide levels were below the threshold for the ECA. In the afternoon and evening, I assisted the engineers in installing a new fan impeller for a cargo deck fan. The previous fan had lost a blade due to an imbalance and that lost blade removed every other blade in the fan in a a sudden incidence of expensive noises. We successfully removed the old impeller hub today and attempted to install the new impeller. However, given that the new impeller was aftermarket, it did not go onto the hub easily. In fact, it refused to go onto the hub until we used a sandpaper wheel on a grinder and removed some of the inner hub. Everyone anticipated that this was going to be an easy job, but it was not completed before dinner as everyone anticipated.

### Day 13: 5/23

Location: underway in the British Channel

Today, I continued yesterday's fan project. I carried the bottles to set up the oxy-acetylene torch to allow the engineers to get the hub "cherry red," as the first engineer called it. This process took all day and I was eventually reassigned to disassemble the motor control box for a separate fan. From there, I troubleshooted the bad ground and identified the component at fault (the terminal post block had chipped and there was no longer any insulative coating on one side). To do this, I used a megger and tested the motor leads, input leads and terminal posts separately and the one with the lowest resistance was the culprit (in this case the terminal post block). I corrected this by taking some insulating foam tape and wrapping it around the terminal block because the ship didn't have any spares. In doing this, I unintentionally shocked myself despite de-energizing and locking out the system. As it turns out, there was another set of wires that fed the control system for the damper actuator that had to be locked out from the engine room. The engineers did not warn me about this and just expected me to avoid them. This was a healthy reminder of the importance of both lock out tag out and tracing all feeder lines to a circuit. It also gave me a very healthy respect for 220v. Today was the first day I felt like I actually learned something not ship-specific on my cadet shipping experience. The importance and application of meggers and resistance testing for troubleshooting will definitely be an invaluable tool now that I understand how they function.

### Day 14: 5/24

Location: underway near Denmark

Today began by resuming work on the fan which underwent rapid and spontaneous unplanned disassembly. When one of the fan blades dislodged, some of the shrapnel disfigured the grating on top of the fan. Using some metal zip ties, I pushed the fan grating down and back into place then secured it to prevent it from going back into its deformed shape. After that, I secured the electrical lines running to the fan and cleaned up my work. After that, I was sent to explore the hard-grounded fan (2-15) which had a low megging resistance of 0.2 M\Omega. The motor control box on the outside of the fan housing proved a significant challenge to remove and was ultimately a fruitless endeavor. The thick layer of paint on the threads of the plug prevented any water from leaking into the box as much as it prevented any wannabe-engineer from opening it up so the box was dry. However, I was able to identify that the source of the ground was on the motor side of the box and not on the cables leading up to the box. Following the wire up, I then disassembled the control box on the motor and promptly discovered the box was full of salt, the components were highly corroded and they looked like they had gotten hot since the water had accumulated within the system. Today, I didn't learn much other than some convenient ways to amplify my force in disassembling stuck pieces of machinery.

### Day 15: 5/25

Location: underway in the Baltic Sea

Ordinarily, a Sunday is an easier day for most of the engineers, but with our anticipated arrival to Latvia tomorrow, there was plenty of work to be done for the engineers. Given my voluntary unpaid overtime over the past week to help with various projects, the engineers decided that I was not allowed to work today. Most of my time was spent cleaning up my project. However, given we are less than 24 hours away from our arrival into Latvia, regulation required that the main engine local control system be tested. As such, I had the opportunity to switch the main engine from bridge control to ECR control and from ECR to local control, start the engine up from each of these locations and answer various bells from the bridge.

### Day 16: 5/26

Location: Latvia

Today, we made our arrival into Latvia to deliver our peaceful beige and camo cargo. This meant doing a procedure for arrivals in the engine room. Particularly, I had to make much more regular rounds of the engine room to make sure everything was running properly and I was assigned the task of managing the steam heat to the main engine given the vastly fluctuating demands on the engine from the bridge. To do this, I had to watch the engine outlet temperature, the jacket water cooler control valve opening percent and use these to set the jacket water steam heater setpoint. It was a complicated dance, but basically the engineers wanted to make sure that the jacket water cooler didn't open at low speeds (35-45 rpm) as this would subcool the engine. Once we made our arrival, we were informed that someone from port state would be coming in the afternoon to inspect the engine room, so I was sent into the bilge to clean up the mess created by a leaking stern tube lube oil cooler. After that, I assisted the chief engineer in conducting preventative maintenance tasks on the main engine, which included blowing down the control and service air to the main engine (but not spring air because then the engine would drop some valves). After that, we tested the fuel cam disengagement solenoids by turning on the turning gear and twisting some air-actuated knobs to engage and disengage the cams, making sure they are fully seated once we were done. 

### Day 17: 5/27

Location: underway in the Baltic Sea

Today got off to a rough start. When I was doing my morning round, I discovered that the main engine lubricating oil purifier pump was leaking oil into its containment very quickly. When I saw it, I immediately rushed to tell the first engineer, who did not think it was a big deal when I described it to him. So, I went and told the third engineer who felt that this was a much bigger deal and made me disable the purifiers and made the first engineer see the mess created by the pump. As it turns out, that specific pump had a valve on the discharge side closed down the line and the pump was dead-heading, pushing oil past the seals. It created a horrible mess, and I got the privilege of cleaning it up. After that, I installed a pipe sealing kit onto a leaking fiberglass pipe. Here, I learned that a water drip is enough to erode a fiberglass pipe. I am optimistic that this seal will be sufficient to hold off this drip even though the kit was most certainly expired. In the afternoon, I disassembled a washing machine to attempt to determine the location of a strange vibration as observed by the deck department. Unfortunately, I did not have any luck and concluded that this was just the normal operation of the washing machine spin cycle. Another crisis averted by an astute member of the engineering department.

### Day 18: 5/28

Location: underway in the North Sea

This morning, I was assigned the task of carrying out an important 6-month preventative maintenance item for all of the ship's air conditioning equipment. There are 8 air conditioners on the ship: two in the bridge, one in the machine shop, one in the switchboard room, two in the control room, one in the galley and one very large unit for the accommodations space. I had to go around inspecting and cleaning all of them. Particularly, I was looking for the condition of the drive belts and would tension them as necessary. The switchboard room air conditioner, the largest of all of the package air conditioners, had a failing belt and was likely weeks away from failing. I secured the air conditioner and replaced this belt. Afterwards, I managed to get my finger crushed in pulley while inspecting an offline air handler unit for the accommodations space, so I definitely learned to appreciate hand placement.

### Day 19: 5/29

Location: Bremerhaven, Germany

Today, the Independence made her arrival into the port of Bremerhaven. I was called to maneuvering watch at 0730 and made regular rounds of the engine room looking for anything amiss. After we arrived, it was time for the main engine scavenge air box cleaning. This meant both myself and the oilers got to wipe down the scavenge air box inside and out, with half of us removing the doors to the scavenge space on the piston-liner side, and the other half crawling into the scavenge air manifold to remove the accumulated carbon and oil off of the walls of the spaces. It was definitely up there with some of my favorite things I've ever done, but it helped me better visualize how port scavenging actually works. After a short dinner, I went and assisted the engineers with reassembling the Moatti lube oil filters which had been disassembled for a thorough cleaning. It was exciting to have the opportunity to make and use gaskets.

### Day 20: 5/30

Location: Bremerhaven, Germany

With the main engine offline, the engineers took the time to work on a lot of maintenance items that can't be completed while the ship is underway. My day began by joining the first engineer in the scavenger air box in performing an inspection on the main engine, which included rings, rods, cylinders, crowns and the liners. All items appeared nominal, except two rings on the number six cylinder had shifted in such a way that the fingers had come into alignment. This couldn't be remedied without the piston being pulled, so the first decided just to note the issue. The ring gaps were inspected using feeler gauges and the groove depths were measured using the depth bar on a caliper. The pistons and rods were inspected visually for thermal abnormalities. After the scavenger box. When that was completed, the second engineer instructed me to climb inside of the exhaust gas boiler to scoop out combustion debris. This was a fairly simple, but gross, job. So, when this was done, I climbed into the bilge to remove a scavenger oil drain tank skin valve. These items almost took me until the very end of the afternoon, and I finished my day by watching the first engineer test the alarms on the main engine. To do this, we put the Kongsberg K-Chief into simulation mode so that the automation would think that the engine was running even when it was not. That way, all of the engine alarms could be tested because many of them would not alarm unless the engine was running.

### Day 21: 5/31

Location: Bremerhaven, Germany

Today the Independence was shifting docks and I was given the maneuvering watch. I reported to the engine room at 2330 (the day prior) and continued to do regular rounds of the engine room until 0150 when we received the finished with engine telegraph and secured the engine. After trying to get some sleep, I returned to the engine room to change over the fuel oil Moatti filters. This was a relatively simple process that involved unbolting the upper flange bolts, then lifting the top casing off of the Moatti. After draining it, we pulled the filter itself out of the casing and transferred it to a bucket full of diesel to soak. From there, it was as simple as dropping the new filter into the casing, installing the casing bolts, then bleeding the air from the newly-installed filter. After that, we pulled the start air valve from the number six cylinder as it was over its hours between overhauls. Once it was removed, we installed a spare which had been relapped and reconditioned. The exciting part was that I got to operate the main engine overhead crane. 

### Day 22: 6/1

Location: Bremerhaven, Germany

Today was a lower-key day than the rest. All of the major preventative maintenance items that were due to be conducted by now had been completed in the past few days. As such, I was given time to work on my project and had the first engineer approve many of my drawings. In the evening, we departed Bremerhaven at 1900, and I had maneuvering watch with the third engineer. This watch was fairly short and mostly uneventful. However, I was instructed to bring the exhaust gas boiler online by opening up the feedwater valves to allow flow to the boiler. I did this incorrectly by opening up the auxiliary flow valves (which aren't regulated by a control valve) and set off the high boiler water level alarm. After that, I had to help the third engineer open up the blowdown valves and drain off the boiler. Today, I learned about the importance of getting enough sleep and tracing valves before lining them up.

## Day 23: 6/2

Location: underway near Belgium

Today was a very uneventful day as we spent most of it maneuvering. While we were underway, I was instructed to clean the Nyrex ejector pump suction strainer. Given that I had never pulled a strainer before, I inspected it and bled pressure from the strainer, before just diving in and removing the flange bolts. With the flange removed, it was ultimately very simple to pull the strainer basket and clean it using high pressure hot water and some brass brushes. While I was in the strainer, I inspected the sacrificial zinc before battening everything up again. Later in the day, I returned for the beginning of our eight-hour Antwerp maneuver where I learned about the ship's inventory system.
