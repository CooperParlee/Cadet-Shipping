## Part 7 Refrigeration/Air-Conditioning (All Vessels)


1.	Write a detailed description of your ship’s refrigeration system and its operation, incorporating the following items:
•	compressors and operation, including unloading of compressor
•	condensers
•	metering device 
•	evaporators
•	safety equipment - cutouts and pressure relief devices
•	leak detection, fixed or manual?

Both of the ship refrigeration compressors had their condenser/receiver discharges tied directly together. After the condenser/receiver was a common filter drier that both compressors connected to. To switch over and start the opposite compressor, first close off the running condenser's discharge which will collect all of that compressor's refrigerant inside of the condenser. Once the low pressure cut out activates for that compressor, close off the inlet for that condenser. Now the other compressor can be started up and the running one taken offline.  

2.	Explain how temperature is controlled in the various ship service boxes.

We had four ship service boxes for the galley: the potato box, meat/fish box, dairy box and vegetable boxes. They all were fed refrigerant along the same header line. An electric thermostat was kept inside of each box and compared the measured temperature of the box to their respective setpoints. Then, when the temperature got too high, the thermostat opened the solenoid valve for that box. Refrigerant was then allowed to flow through the thermostatic expansion valve (TXV) for that box. The TXV was continually actuated by measuring superheat off of the outlet of the evaporator (which effectively was the temperature of the box) using a sensing bulb. As the gaseous medium inside of the sensing bulb heated up, pressure would increase in the capillary tube, exerting a force due to pressure on the top of the diaphragm for the TXV, opening the valve further and admitting more refrigerant to the evaporator within the service box, cooling the temperature of the space further. In theory, a TXV should fully seal and not allow anymore refrigerant through the valve once the temperature setpoint is met. However, in practice, there will often be a little bit of leak by. This is why the solenoids exist, to completely cut off flow to the system once the set temperature is reached. 

3.	Explain how cooling water flow through the ship’s refrigeration condensers is controlled.

Water flow through the ship's refrigeration condensers was controlled by orifice plates and gate valves. The gate valves did not offer significant control over the water flow through the refrigeration system, but did allow for isolation of the cooling system at those points. The major regulator for pressure were the orifice plates. The designers of the system knew the design pressure of the central fresh water system and stepped it down to safe levels for the refrigeration condenser cooling system using intentionally-sized orifice plates.

4.	List and describe any maintenance performed on the refrigeration system while you were aboard.

There was very little maintenance performed on the ship's refrigeration system while I was onboard. While I was onboard, the chief engineer replaced the compressor oil for the inboard refrigerant compressor and added more refrigerant to the outboard compressor. He suggested that he would just wait for the telltale alarm that the potato box temperature was getting too high to add refrigerant. He said that the potato box was always the first system to start increasing in temperature because it was the last system at the end of the refrigerant header. From there, he would connect up his refrigerant bottle with gauges to the compressor suction and discharge and add additional refrigerant per the manufacturer's guidelines.

5.	What type refrigerant is used in the ship service refrigeration system? What is the boiling point of the refrigerant at atmospheric pressure?

Our ship used R-407C which was a zeotropic mixture (400-series) of difluoromethane (R-32), pentafluoroethane (R-125), and tetrafluoroethane (R-134a). The zeotropic nature of the refrigerant means that the different component gases will fractionate, or separate out at different boiling points meaning that the refrigerant must be added as a liquid. The boiling point, however, is generally considered to be -43.8 \degC at atmospheric pressure despite the fractionation potential.

6.	What are the EPA certification requirements for technicians handling the various types of refrigerants used on your ship? Discuss briefly.

The two types of refrigerant being handled on my vessel were R407C and R134a. EPA certifications for handling refrigerants are based upon the capacity and type of system and not based upon the type of refrigerant being used. All systems on my vessel were greater than 10kg of charge and are high pressure systems. This means that they are governed by the EPA 608 type-2 license which pertains to systems that are over 5 pounds of charge and high pressure. However, myself and most of the engineers had EPA 608 universal, meaning they are authorized to handle type II systems in addition to type I (high pressure, lower than 5 lb of charge) and type-III systems (low pressure systems).

7.	List and describe how you would manually test for refrigeration leakage.

To test for refrigerant leakage on the relatively small systems on my ship, I would use a sniffer to first detect whether a leak was present. Sniffers are highly sensitive, so they would warn even if the leak was very small. However, if I had multiple units in close proximity, one might cause the other to trip positive. So, if a leak was suspected, my best bet would be to pull a vacuum on the system and see if the vacuum holds before recharging the system with more refrigerant. Then, to identify the leak, I would spray down the pipe with soapy water to see where bubbles formed. The size of the leak will determine the size of the bubbles created. I would specifically spray around fittings and areas where it looked like the pipe might rub and chafe. If I had no luck pinpointing the leak this way, I could use the halide torch method to pinpoint the leak for certain types of refrigerant (chlorinated refrigerants). Unfortunately, R407C is not a chlorinated refrigerant so this wouldn't work.

8.  List and describe your ship's air conditioning system and its operation.

My vessel contained mostly package air conditioning systems for various important locations throughout the ship. There were a total of 7 different package air conditioners: two on the bridge, two in the engine control room, one in the machine shop, one in the galley and one in the switchboard room. All of the package units were the same with the exception of the unit in the switchboard room which was much larger and had more redundancy (two compressors, for example). Operationally, these were fairly simple. They contained a switch for fan or air condition. In air condition mode, they would either move heat to or from the air in the space by using or adding energy to the air near the conditioner. They also had a switch for heating or cooling mode depending on what was necessary in context. 

9.	List and describe the following for the AC compressors and include quantity, type, number of cylinders, bore, stroke, rpm, etc.
10.	List and describe any maintenance performed on the air conditioning system while you were aboard.  

Very minimal maintenance was performed on the air conditioning system while I was onboard. Most of the air conditioning units were self-contained package units which did not require much in the way of servicing. While I was onboard, I was assigned the task of the 6-month service, which included cleaning the internals of the system, filters, inspecting for corrosion and checking the belts. I had to replace two belts on the air conditioner air handler unit for the main switchboard room.
