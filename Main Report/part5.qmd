## Part 5 Line Shafting and Stern Tube (As Applicable)

1.  List and describe the line shafting, including the number and construction of line shaft or spring bearings and the material and construction of the shafting.
2.  How is a line shaft bearing lubricated? What type and viscosity oil is used?
3.  List and describe some of the reasons that would cause a line shaft bearing to run hot. What actions would you take if your ship had a hot line shaft bearing?
4.  If your ship is equipped with a controllable pitch propeller, describe the major components of the system, and explain how pitch is varied.
5.  Explain how the propeller is held on the tail shaft and explain in detail how to "pull" a tail shaft.
6.  What type of stern tube is used? Describe in detail how it is lubricated.
7.  List and describe the thrust bearing and explain how it transfers the propeller thrust.
8.  What is the pitch and diameter of the propeller? (for controllable pitch propellers, state maximum ahead and astern pitch). Explain how "engine miles traveled" is calculated.

Engine miles traveled is given by the following equation:

$$
d_{engine} = \frac{Pitch(meters/rev) \times Revolutions}{1000(km/meter)}
$$

1.  Provide an example of a day's run of engine miles, slip, and observed miles. Explain how you could compute the average RPMs and total revolutions for a 24-hour period. If your ship doesnâ€™t use this method, what is used to determine engine efficiency? For example: speed versus amount of fuel burned.
