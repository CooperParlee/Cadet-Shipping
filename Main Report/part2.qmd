Part 2A Main Propulsion, Diesel or Diesel Electric

1.	List and describe the main propulsion diesel engine(s) on your ship in detail including size, speed, power, cycle, type drive, reversing method, control, and the timing of events.

The Doosan MAN B&W 7S60MC-C Mk7 main propulsion diesel engine of the ARC Independence is a two-stroke single-acting direct-drive, direct reversing crosshead diesel engine rated for 21,490 BHP (15820 KW) at 105 RPM. With this engine the vessel could make 14 kts at full ahead. The total displacement was 4,753 liters. The firing order of the engine was 1-7-2-5-4-3-6.

2.	What is the designation of the main propulsion unit?	Explain its meaning (e.g. Wartsila 6L20).

The main propulsion unit was a Doosan MAN B&W 7S60MC-C Mk7. The 7 refers to the seven inline cylinders on the engine. S means a "super" long stroke. 60 refers to the cylinder diameter in centimeters and the "MC-C" refers to the engine being a compact camshaft-controlled engine model.

Given that my vessel's main engine was direct drive, there were no reduction gears or clutches on my engine. The only thing between the main engine and the propeller was the shaft generator, which is included above for the content's sake of this question.

4.	What type of governors or engine speed control devices are used on the engine?	Give their name plate data.

NOT DONE

5.	Describe operation of the overspeed protection system and how it is tested on your vessel.

The overspeed protection system is designed to prevent the engine from destroying itself if it exceeds the safe limits of the system, effectively preventing a runaway condition. The overspeed trip setpoint was set at 109% of the maximum rated speed of the engine, or 114 rpm. This overspeed protection system disengages the fuel supply to the main engine after the magnetic rpm speed sensor on the shaft detects that the engine is speeding faster than this setpoint speed. To test this system, the engine is never actually oversped because that is highly unsafe. Instead, the Kongsberg is put into simulation mode and the speed of the engine is set manually above this overspeed setpoint. Then, you ensure that an overspeed trip alarm comes up on the Kongsberg.

6.	What differences in the plant operation/setup did you observe when entering and leaving port (at sea-maneuvering modes)?   i.e., sea suctions, type fuel oil, pressure and temperature adjustments made, extra equipment started etc.?

There were quite a few differences in plant operation between maneuvering and at-sea operation. When maneuvering, both diesel generators were running and the shaft generator was offline. The main engine used MGO instead of heavy fuel (B30 or VLSFO) when navigating near port both due to emission control areas and for reliability. The evaporator was taken offline when near port and maneuvering. The auxiliary boiler was brought online instead of the exhaust gas boiler when maneuvering into port. Additionally, the jacket water inlet temperature to the main engine was closely monitored to ensure that it was not too low if the engine was being run at lower speeds for maneuvering. If this was likely, the jacket water preheater was used to keep the temperatures up. Additionally, they would raise the jacket water heater setpoints to keep the temperatures around 75-85 \degC. Instead of using the low sea suction, the high sea suction was used, especially for shallow depths. 

7.	List and describe the fuel oil storage and transfer system.
8.	Give a full description of the fuel oil supply to the fuel injection pumps, including the purification system.
9.	Give a full description of the fuel injection system including the control and variation of the timing and metering employed.

The fuel injection system on my vessel was a mechanical injection system that was retrofitted with MAN Performance Measurement Indicator (PMI) Variable Injection Timing (VIT). The mechanical component of the engine included your bog-standard port and helix style injection pump. There were two racks that fed into each of the injector pumps: the fuel rack and the VIT rack. The fuel rack turned to rotate the pump plunger which determined how much fuel was admitted to the injector because of how long the milled slot on that side of the plunger was. If the milled slot was larger, the spill port of the pump would be uncovered earlier which ended fuel injection sooner.

The other rack connected to each of the pumps individually and was electrically driven. This was the VIT rack. The VIT rack changes the position of the fuel pump sleeve to make the timing of fuel admission earlier or later to either speed up or delay combustion.

10.	Explain the path of lube oil flow throughout the engine. How are the liners and bearings lubricated?
11.	Provide detailed specifications of the various lubrication oils used for this engine. This may be obtained from product data sheets. Give approximate consumption figures.

12.	Describe the procedure for getting the engine ready for sea, that is, ready for leaving port.

In order to get the engine ready to leave port, we first put the second diesel generator in standby mode to start when the bow thruster is started. The main engine lube oil pump is started and the lube oil temperature regulator (LC09) is set to 45\degC. The central fresh water cooling pump is started and the smaller "in port" CFW pump is stopped. The start air compressors are set to the manual position. The control air and safety air valves on the main engine are opened to be blown down; this is found on the forward end of the main engine on the lower level. The bridge is then called for wheel clearance and the main engine is put into pre-lube mode by pressing the "pre lub" button on the Alpha Lubricator panel in the ECR. Next, the turning gear is run for 7 minutes. The turning gear must first be engaged by pulling the big lever by the gear, closing the breaker and pushing the forward button. After 7 minutes, the turning gear can be secured and the start air and start air pilot valves can be opened on the aft end of the upper level near the main engine. Next is the "slow turn" main engine blowdown procedure. The engine is put into this mode by pushing the slow turn button on the main engine indicating panel and putting the telegraph to the dead slow position. The maneuvering panel to the left of the telegram is brought up to the start position to admit turning air to the main engine. When this is complete, the telegraph can be moved to the stop position and the slow turn indicator can be disabled on the indicator panel. With this completed, the indicator cocks can be closed on the main engine. Wait for the pilot to board, then start the second diesel generator, placing both in "stop block" mode to prevent the automation from taking a generator offline due to low load. Now, notify the bridge that the generators are online. Start the main engine fuel oil supply and circulating pumps. Now, wait for the bridge standby order for the main engine.

Now that the bridge is calling for standby, acknowledge the standby call on the telegraph. Switch the main engine control switch from engine room control to bridge control and put the auxiliary blowers in auto. Start the main engine jacket water cooling pump at the first bell from the bridge. Adjust the jacket water preheater (SL67) as needed, starting the preheating pump if the preheater is necessary. Once the exhaust gas boiler reaches 5 bar, open the EGB feed water valves to start the boiler. 

With these steps completed, all of the main engine systems are ready for operation to leave port.

13.	Describe the external lube oil system including filters and coolers.

The external lube oil system began outside of the main engine sump at the two positive displacement lube oil pumps. From there, the oil traveled to one large lube oil cooler. This was a plate type lube oil cooler and I particularly found it interesting that there was no redundancy here. After the plate type heat exchanger was the lube oil filtering system. The main system included two Moatti lube oil filters installed in series and included a bypass that was a fairly standard 40-\mu filter/strainer. After this filtering system, there was a lube oil sampling point. From here, the oil went to the various engine systems: cylinder cooling, system oil, and turbochargers. Before which point, there was another small 200-\mu strainer in case all else had failed. 

14.	Describe the purification, transfer, and storage system for the lube oil.

The main engine lube oil purification system begins at the main engine lube oil settling and/or sump tanks. A set of two positive displacement pumps can draw suction for either or both tanks and send the lube oil to a purifier. One pump is intended for the generator lube oil system, but has a crossover for the main engine lube oil system. The two pumps are rated for 2.5 m^3/hr at a pressure of 4 bar. After the two pumps are the lube oil purifier heaters. These are two steam-heated plate type heat exchangers designed to improve the pumpability and reduce the viscosity of the lube oil. After the heaters, the lube oil arrives in one of two lube oil purifiers, each rated for 2,500 liters/hr. Again, one purifier is intended for the generator lube oil and the other is intended for the main engine, but both can operate for the other system via a crossover. The purifiers operate on the property of different densities. Purifier discs spin very fast within the purifier. Oil is admitted to the purifier and is centripetally accelerated along the inside of the disc. Lower densities stratify away from the higher density elements meaning lighter components like lube oil stay closer to the center of the disk and heavier elements such as water or solid contaminates will separate towards the outside of the housing. As the outside gets dirty, the purifier will occasionally "shoot the bowl," an intentional forcing of lube oil out out of the disc stack, carrying with it all of the contaminants that had collected on the outside of the housing. This is all carried into the lube oil sludge tank, a 10.8 m^3 tank where all of the contaminants for the lube oil purification process are kept.

15.	Explain how to check the L.O. level. When and how often was this done? Explain how to add oil to the engine.

There were two important and different types of oil for the main engine: cylinder and system oil. The main engine cylinder L.O. level was checked at the cylinder lube oil head tank two levels above the engine room via a staircase on the port side. This level was checked at the beginning of the day during the oiler round or whenever any alarms for lube oil went off. Additionally, it was continuously monitored by the Kongsberg system via a sensor in the main engine cylinder oil sump tank. The system oil was also monitored by a tank level indicator but was also checked manually. Since the system oil sump tank was located below the main engine, the tank level was checked via a sounding every day by the oiler on the "inside round." They would then check their innage value against a tank table posted just adjacent to the sounding tube that was located just forward of the shaft generator.

To add more of either oil to the main engine, it is as simple as lining the respective tank with the lube oil transfer pump and transferring it to the respective sump for that oil.

16.	What is meant by "supercharging or turbocharging"? Explain how this is accomplished on your plant.

Turbocharging and supercharging function to raise the effective scavenging pressure of the engine to increase efficiency and power of the main engine. In a turbocharger, the force due to the pressure of the exhaust gases is used to turn the blades of the turbocharger impeller. The work produced my turning this impeller is used to turn the intake-side impeller, raising the intake pressure and forcing more air into the cylinders of the engine. Turbocharging is not a parasitic draw. Supercharging is the process of using engine work to drive a blower to force air into the engine. It is considered a parasitic draw because it removes some shaft horsepower from the engine to drive the blower, however, it also increases the overall power of the engine. On the ARC Independence, the main engine was both turbocharged and supercharged. The turbo is driven by the exhaust gas and is used to force air from the surrounding engine room into the charge air cooler. 

![Main engine forward turbocharger](Pictures/part2/me_turbo.png)

After the charge air cooler are electrically-driven auxiliary blowers. These can further increase the scavenge air pressure going into the engine but are not entirely necessary to the operation of the plant except in conditions with little exhaust gas pressure when the engine is not at high enough speed (such as maneuvering). 

![Main engine aftermost blower/supercharger](Pictures/part2/blower.png)
17.	Give a full description of the complete cooling water system, including any seawater or Closed Fresh Water circuits.

There were three different water cooling systems involved with the main engine, jacket water, central fresh water and sea water systems. The jacket water system was a treated demineralized water system that comprised three pumps. Two of the pumps were large centrifugal pumps which provided the bulk of the flow through the system. There was an additional pump which pumped jacket water through a steam preheater which was a small plate-type heat exchanger. After the jacket water traveled through the main engine, it went through the Nyrex which effectively acted as a heat exchanger for the jacket water system. After the Nyrex came the three way temperature control valve which determined how much flow was bypassed and how much flow was sent to the coolers. The two large plate-type coolers cooled the jacket water system with central fresh water (or the LT system). The central fresh water system cooled many of the secondary engine systems, including the turbochargers, lube oil, stern tube, shaft generator and charge air cooler. It comprised three pumps; two pumps were large centrifugal pumps that were on/off and used when at sea, and the third pump was a smaller centrifugal pump that was controlled by a VFD and used in port. This VFD-controlled pump was a rare exception aboard the ship and was installed during a shipyard retrofit. There were two CFW coolers that were plate type heat exchangers. These were cooled by the sea water system. The sea water system did not include any heat exchangers except for the ocean. It comprised three pumps and two sea suctions, a high and a low. The three pumps were started and stopped as needed by the automation and were not VFD-controlled. 

18.	Fully describe the starting system equipment and its operation.

Starting with the compressors, the two Sperre HV2 compressors kept the two Kumkang 7,000L start air reservoirs pressurized to 30 bar. After the start air reservoirs, the start air ran into the main start air valve. This valve was electronically operated when the engine was starting and stayed in the normally closed position. There was a manual actuator outside of the valve to force the valve open for starting.
![Main start air valve with manual actuator]()
After the actuator, some of the start air traveled to the start air distributor which included a cam that was directly connected and timed to the main engine. This distributor sent air to drive the start air valves on each of the cylinders at the appropriate time (TDC) to drive the piston down and turn over the engine

19.	What is "tappet clearance” or “valve lash" and how is it adjusted on the intake/exhaust valves?

Valve lash is the gap between the top of the valve stem and the valve train. It is used to accomodate for wear and thermal expansion on intake and exhaust valves. The engine on my vessel was port scavenged, meaning it doesn't have intake valves, only exhaust valves. This is adjusted by turning the specific cylinder to top dead center (TDC) and inserting the feeler gauge per the manufacturer instructions between the rocker arm and the valve stem. Then, turn the adjusting screw until drag is experienced on the feeler gauge. Finally, lock the adjusting screw and recheck the clearance with that feeler gauge by ensuring there is sufficient drag on that feeler gauge.

20.	List and describe in detail any maintenance or repairs performed on the main engine while you were on board.

On May 29, the main engine scavenge air receiver was opened and cleaned. It was pretty simple, albeit very important and labor intensive. It included scraping off carbon deposits from inside the scavenge space and then wiping up all of the oil inside. It was important because it reduces the risk of scavenge airbox fires.
 
21.	List and describe the air compressors on your ship, including their type, number, size, pressures, and what the air is used for.

For the main engine start air, there are two Sperre HV2 4-cylinder V-type reciprocating compressors with a capacity of 250 $m^3/hr$ rated for a pressure of 30 bar. The compressed air is used for starting the main engine. 

![Sperre HV2 air compressor]()

There is also a much smaller Sperre HL2/77 2-cylinder V-type reciprocating compressor rated at 20 $m^3/hr$ at 30 bar used for producing start air for the diesel generators during the event of a plant blackout. This compressor is the only one on the emergency bus. 

![Sperre HL2/77](Pictures/part2/estart_air.PNG)

The last air compressor was the Atlas Copco GA37FF screw-type working air compressor rated for 7.1 $m^3/hr$ at 7.5 bar. It also provided control air after that air traveled through a drier. It is important to note that the chief on my vessel chose to use the crossover from the start air lines to provide control air because he felt that it provided higher capacity, but the previous chief felt that control air should be provided by the working air compressor.

![Atlas Copco GA37FF](Pictures/part2/working_air.PNG)

22.	If the main engines could be controlled from the bridge, list in order the process of transferring control from engine control room to bridge. List precautions.

In order to transfer control from the engine room to the bridge, one must first ensure that the engine operated telegraph (EOT) matched the bridge operated telegraph (BOT) and the fuel rack setting on the manual controller. Making contact with the bridge, switch the engine control selector switch from "C/R Control" to "Bridge Control." They can then request control off of the BOT. An engineer in the control room will then push the bridge control button on the EOT to acknowledge that the bridge has taken control. As far as precautions go, there are fewer precautions necessary when switching from engine control to bridge control then there are navigational precautions necessary for the other way around. The most important precautions are to ensure that the EOT, BOT and fuel rack are at the same location and direction and that the engine speed is not set too low (that it might risk stalling the engine).

23.	List and describe the procedure to transfer main engine control from control room to the emergency position at the engine maneuvering stand or local operating panel. List any precautions to be taken during this evolution.

In order to transfer engine control from ECR to the local operating panel, first the engine control selector switch must be in "C/R Control" instead of "Bridge Control" in the engine control room. Before switching, it is important to ensure that you have communications with the bridge from the local operating panel and have someone in the control room to acknowledge a "local control" alarm that comes up when switching modes. Additionally, it is important to make sure that there is adequate air pressure in the start air tanks to handle stopping and starting because to switch control modes, there will be a change in fuel rack position. For example in switching from ECR to local control, if your throttle was set to 80 rpm on the ECR throttle and 40 rpm on the local throttle, a noticeable "bump" (as the Chief called it) will be observed in the main engine. That is why it was recommended that switching modes for testing was conducted when the engine was offline. Additionally, it is crucial to note that operating from the local control station cuts out all safeties and the governor for the engine. In doing so, if a lube oil pump stops pumping oil or the pressure is too low, the local control console will continue to actuate the engine. As such, it is important to keep an oiler doing continuous rounds around the engine room to ensure that everything is running properly. This process requires that the engine room be continuously manned. In order to actually conduct the changeover, a magnet has to be removed from the position blocking device (which was added because the blocking device tended to vibrate loose). 
The handwheel below the console is then set to the manual position.
![Remove magnet, remove block, and set handwheel to the manual position]()
Then, set the valve for ahead or astern to the correct position.
![Ahead/astern selector valve]()
Finally, change the valve from remote to manual mode.
![Remote/manual valve]()
From there, one pushes and holds the start button on the control console until the engine catches, then slide the fuel rack controller into the "start" position.

24.	What is the viscosity of the fuels used on board? Was the injection viscosity controlled? If so, explain this process.

The Independence burned MGO, VLSFO and B30 biofuel. The viscosity of MGO at 40\deg C was determined via lab testing to be 3.3 cSt. The viscosities for VLSFO and B30 at 50\deg C are 171.4 cSt and 57 cSt respectively. At 100\deg C, they are 21.4 cSt and 10.7 cSt respectively. Given the low viscosity of MGO, the injection viscosity was not controlled. However, with the high viscosities for VLSFO and B30, these injection viscosities were controlled electronically with the Alfa Laval OPrem system. This system measured the viscosity and temperature of the fuel oil going to the engine and adjusted the amount of steam going to the fuel oil heaters. When switching to and from MGO and a residual fuel, the temperature was controlled manually by the OPrem system, not the viscosity. This was because the MGO was not to be heated above 85\degC. 

The only time the engineers really had to manually adjust the OPrem system was when they were changing from a heavy fuel to diesel fuel. To adjust the system, they would slowly increase or decrease (for switching to or from a heavy fuel, respectively) the manual temperature setpoint on the system in increments of 5-10\degC so as not to cause the system to go into a thermal runaway alarm. They found that the system would go into this runaway alarm if they explicitly set the final setpoint because the system felt it was not reaching that temperature fast enough and would raise an alarm. As such, the engineers learned to manually adjust the system in times of changeover.

25.	List and describe the main engine protection devices, including alarms and trips. Explain how they were tested for satisfactory operation. How often are they tested?

There were a great many alarms and trips on our engine since there were a lot of electronic automations for it. Temperature alarms included the main bearing lube oil inlet temperatures, piston cooling temperatures (for all cylinders), jacket water temperature (all cylinders and overall inlet), multiple sensors for the scavenge air with some in the manifold and others on the scavenger air receiver on certain cylinders, the thrust pad, camshaft oil temperature, turbocharger exhaust gas inlet and outlet temperatures. For pressures, there were the start air manifolds, piston cooling pressures, charge air cooler inlet pressure from the CFW system, lube oil (which was a trip), and jacket water. Other alarms included the oil mist, fuel oil leakage alarm, turning gear engaged, overspeed trip and the piston cooling no-flow alarm. To test them for satisfactory operation, the engine was first put into simulation mode with all of the supporting equipment turned on (lube oil, start air, fuel oil, jacket water etc). From there, it was a matter of setting the simulated engine RPM then testing the specific alarm. Temperature alarms were tested by removing the sensor and placing it into a heater, called the "hotpot," and then allowing it to reach its alarm point. Pressure alarms were tested by securing fluid flow to sensor on the engine, then bleeding the line to the sensor. This causes the alarm by dropping the pressure at the transducer. Oil mist was tested by spraying "canned smoke" into the inlet of the oil mist detection sensor which interrupts the transmission of light within the sensor. The turning gear alarm is triggered by holding down the limit switch on the turning gear lever while in simulated mode and waiting for the alarm. The overspeed trip was tested by lowering the engine overspeed limit on the Kongsberg to below the simulated RPM and waiting for the alarm. All of these alarms were to be tested yearly, but were staggered throughout the year to reduce the amount of time it would take to test all of them.

26.	What type of bearings are used for main, crankpin and crosshead applications? How is wear on these bearings checked?

The crosshead bearings are slipper/shell-type bearings manufactured of cast steel with a white metal coating on the surface. White metal is a silvery alloy generally containing tin. 

The main bearing is a thin-walled shell-type bearing composed of steel and coated with a white metal on the bearing surfaces.

The crankpin is a thin-walled steel shell bearing that is lined with a babbitted bearing material.

Wear on these bearings is checked a bunch of ways. First, bearing temperature is monitored during normal operation and high bearing temperatures tend to indicate a bad bearing. It can also be checked more precisely by visual inspection (if it's rough and scored, it's in bad shape) if the engine is offline and bearings are removed. Without removing the bearings though, their condition can be checked with crank web deflections and Plastiguages. If a bearing is worn, it will cause a minute deflection in the crank webs because the crank shaft physically bends because it is unsupported by the worn bearing surface. This can be measured with the precise measurement instruments in the crank web deflection. With Plastigauges, the stock material is cut slightly shorter than the width of the bearing you are inspecting and placed on the journal surface. Then, the bearing cap is tightened and torqued before it is removed again along with the Plastigauge. Then, the width of the Plastigauge is compared with the scale to determine what the bearing clearance is, which tells you how worn the bearing itself is.

27.	What is "crank web deflection"? Provide a copy of a “crank web deflection” report.
